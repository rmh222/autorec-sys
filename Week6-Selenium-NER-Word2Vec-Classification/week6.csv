Stockholm, Sweden. Two men — Ludo and Daniel — stand by a portable sauna mounted on a trailer bed. “So, you were in here?” Daniel says, pointing forcefully. “And they just took it from you?” Ludo confirms. “Oh, my God,” Daniel says, turning to the camera in the manner of someone practiced at generating on-the-scene narration for viewers at home: “Crazy story. You go to the sauna. You’re relaxing inside. And the next thing you know, your bike, which is parked next to you, just gets stolen. Double-locked, they carried it away.” He’s visibly peeved: This can’t stand. “Nah. Let’s find this bike.”', 'Welcome to “Bike Hunters,” a YouTube series produced by VanMoof, a Dutch e-bike company. When you buy a VanMoof, starting at $2,298, you can also subscribe to a theft-protection package. If your bike is stolen, VanMoof will either recover it within two weeks — possibly by sending Daniel or another “hunter” — or replace it. Each VanMoof comes with an electronic tracking system designed to make it easier to find. I’ve watched VanMoof’s bike hunters, tracking devices in hand, traipsing through cities all over the world — Berlin, San Francisco, London, Tokyo — following signals to street corners, basements, scrap-metal sites and tent cities. (The series bumps up against urban poverty and homelessness, but tends to restrict itself to thinking about them in terms of bike security.) Often the hunters themselves cruise from clue to clue on VanMoofs, showing off the bikes’ sleek design and the benefits of giving your pedaling an electronic boost.', 'Sometimes the hunters find the bike chained up — or parked in a specialized structure that may, to American viewers, look like something from another world — and liberate it with a power cutter. Sometimes they confront the bike’s new “owner,” always possibly the thief himself, but perhaps just someone who got a deal they might have known was too good to be true. (“I bought it for 10 euros,” one man says, shrugging.) Whatever happens, the story is told in the grammar of reality TV. Quick-cut montages boil hours of searches and stakeouts down to mere minutes, backed by techno music that makes the hunts feel consistently adrenalized. The hunters speak in narrative beats: “Let’s find this bike. ... We were waiting for this bike to move, and it just moved. ... We have to go right now!”', 'In Stockholm, Daniel and Ludo follow the tracker signal to a group of apartment buildings. As they interview residents, Daniel picks up “super tense” energy from a man who runs off before they can approach him. Searching the area, they spot a telltale VanMoof handlebar sticking out from a balcony. Daniel uses a digital signal to verify it’s Ludo’s bike, then calls the police, who help recover it. Overjoyed, Ludo hops on and begins riding.', '“Bike Hunters” takes a product category with massive potential to increase the public good, then talks about it in a surprisingly goofy way: via reality-TV-inflected short videos about young people executing what sometimes seem like awfully inefficient retrieval operations. (In two early episodes, several VanMoof employees flew from the Netherlands to Ukraine and Romania, spending days, and significant amounts of carbon, on the trails of bikes they never found.) The show can be a little silly. It’s for exactly this reason that it feels terribly important.', 'Consider cars, the core of the problem e-bikes promise to help solve. Much of cars’ dominance of United States transit culture stems from the accumulated power of a century of political decisions. But some credit must also be given to the car’s great success at infiltrating every crevice of our culture. Cars come to us in advertisements, in films, in song lyrics; they’re powerful, they’re sexy, they’re fun.', 'Bicycles, by contrast — the everyday, getting-from-A-to-B type — are offered as the vegetables to cars’ steak. Prudent and responsible, maybe. Powerful and sexy, definitely not. Ditto for the likes of public transit and walkable neighborhoods, options often presented in the sober register of a nonprofit report. There’s talk of safety, public health and the negatives we might avoid: death and injury counts, toxic emission figures, congestion statistics. We hear about fun and pleasure only in footnotes and asides, if at all. This dynamic applies far beyond transit. Eating less meat, buying less clothing, wearing masks indoors during a disease outbreak: Too often, demonstrably good interventions arrive via scolding exhortations to eat our vegetables, both real and metaphorical. Not because the vegetables are tasty, but because eating steak is bad for the planet and we should know better.', 'Psychologists distinguish between “avoidance motivation” (which steers us away from threats) and “approach motivation” (which guides us toward rewards), stressing the need for individuals to balance the two. People who drink too much, for example, might have a better chance of changing if they can, in addition to understanding alcohol’s negative toll on their life, envision how drinking less could add positives, like better relationships with loved ones. “If I can’t dance, I don’t want to be in your revolution,” the anarchist Emma Goldman is often quoted as saying. In fact, the phrase seems to have been coined by an activist printing T-shirts for a fund-raiser, but the point stands: Surely we need more to look forward to than the avoidance of worst-case scenarios.', 'In its own small way, “Bike Hunters” offers a hint of how to gaze forward. Importantly, it exists not to make you feel bad but to make you want a fancy bike — to see a bike as an aspirational good, more steak than vegetable, something you would be crushed to have stolen. The episodes are littered with scenes of bike-\u200brelated happiness. A crowd gathered on an Amsterdam street cheers while hunters grind the lock off a stolen bike. A Moroccan medical student who learns he has bought a stolen bike invites the hunters in for tea, signs up to be a hunter himself and gets a free bike as a thank-you. We see how pleased VanMoof owners are to have their bikes recovered, as if getting pieces of their lives back. In my favorite episodes, the hunt showcases the everyday pleasures and conveniences of bikeable streets and bike-friendly spaces. We see bikes everywhere, woven into the fabric of neighborhood life. It always looks like something worth working toward. Yes, the way the show whistles past the radical inequalities of urban life can be annoying. (Though it’s nothing compared with, say, media coverage of carjacking.) But it would be a mistake to let this discredit its entire method. The lens is a powerful one; it just needs to be widened.', 'Since watching the Stockholm episode, hardly a week has gone by in which I haven’t imagined how wonderful it would be to feel safe biking to a sauna, emerging refreshed and biking off again into the rest of my day. After Ludo has his bike back, he and Daniel head to downtown Stockholm for karaoke. Daniel sings ABBA’s “Super Trouper”: “Smiling, having fun/Feeling like a number one.” Ludo opts for “Feeling Good,” a song used often in commercials for cars, including the 2022 Toyota Tundra pickup. “It’s a new dawn,” it says. “It’s a new day, it’s a new life.”', 'Source photographs: Screen grabs from YouTube']","['bike', 'hunter', 'VanMoof', 'car', 'Daniel', 'life', 'Stockholm', 'episode', 'vegetable', 'way', 'signal', 'street', 'Hunters', 'Bike', 'scene', 'transit', 'man', 'steak', 'sauna', 'day']",images/10.png

That’s the equivalent of buying a fancy new smartphone every month.', 'So this winter, I embarked on a test of energy-saving tech. In January 2021, my energy bill peaked at $370. I wanted to see if I could do better.', 'For my experiment, I adjusted my Nest smart thermostat to control my heat and lower my gas expenses. For electricity, I experimented with internet-connected plugs that could be programmed to turn off appliances and devices at certain hours to avoid wasting energy.', 'The great news: My winter energy bills dropped to an average of about $250 a month from an average of $310. The bad news: An energy-efficiency expert paid a visit and, while concluding that the bill could drop by 1.5 times more, said there was a lot to do for my home that gadgets would not solve.', '“Tech is helpful for sure, but most likely won’t take a huge bite out of bills,” said the expert, Mickey Souza, the owner of Energineers, a home energy auditing firm in the San Francisco Bay Area. She added that the main culprit of a home’s high energy costs was usually improper insulation.', 'Here are the three main lessons I learned.', 'There is no one-size-fits-all advice for saving energy. I learned this in December 2020 when I first started using Google’s Nest thermostat, which can create a heating and cooling schedule based on your usage habits throughout the day.', 'The Department of Energy and utilities like PG&E and Consolidated Edison recommended setting the thermostat at 68 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter. So I programmed the Nest for 68 throughout the day.', 'When the $370 bill arrived a month later, I realized that the rule of thumb was terrible for my two-bedroom home, which was built in the 1960s with insulation treated as an afterthought. Once the house reached 68 degrees, it couldn’t retain that temperature for long, so the furnace powered back on about 20 minutes later.', 'This is all to say that saving energy with tech requires some independent thinking. While leaving the thermostat at 68 all day may make sense for small apartments in well-insulated buildings, this is generic advice that many homes probably wouldn’t benefit from, said Ben Brown, Google’s product manager for the Nest thermostat.', 'Instead, ask yourself some questions. What is the size of your home? What do you know about the insulation? How long does it take to heat up a few degrees? And most important, at what temperature would you and your family feel comfortable?', 'In November, I decided to try to make the Nest work better with my home this winter. After tinkering with the Nest’s settings and studying my energy costs every day for a month, I concluded that this was the best schedule for my house:', '6:30 a.m.: Raise the temperature to 66, for when it’s time to get out of bed.', '8 a.m.: Set the temperature to 60 so that the temperature steadily drops throughout the day. This made the house a bit chilly but tolerable wearing a sweater.', '8 p.m.: Raise the temperature to 66, for when it gets cold at night (and after PG&E’s peak-pricing period).', '11 p.m.: Set the temperature to 57, for bedtime.', 'During this experiment, the Nest thermostat also gave me a “heads-up” warning that my furnace was turning on and off every few minutes, which meant something was wrong. I hired an HVAC professional who diagnosed and fixed the problem: The gas pressure was too high, causing the furnace to overheat and shut down automatically.', 'This solution, combined with the programmed heating schedule, led to a significant drop in my bills.', 'In December, after finishing my experiment with gas, I turned my attention to electricity. The results were less remarkable.', 'I tested smart plugs from TP-Link, which offers a smartphone app to program the light switches and devices to turn on and off on a schedule. I also plugged in devices that were frequent offenders of so-called vampire energy, which suck power even when not in use. They included a large speaker, a laptop charger and a phone charger, for which I programmed the plugs to stay on only when I was likely to use them.', 'Over a few weeks, I studied my bills. The differences in energy costs were marginal.', 'That’s not to say we shouldn’t try to avoid wasting small amounts of power. But if your goal is to cut down on your bill, look elsewhere.', 'After the tests, I brought in Ms. Souza of Energineers, who toured my home for two hours and delivered the unfortunate news: There were major issues with my home’s “shell” — that is, the roof and walls.', '“The shell naturally is the most important piece of efficiency,” she said. “Just like the shell on a turtle, it’s going to keep whatever’s out there that you don’t want from coming into your home.”', 'Using an infrared camera, Ms. Souza showed that my roof lacked adequate insulation and that the walls had none at all. She also found that some ducts lacked insulation. There were also holes throughout the home where air was leaking out of the house.', 'Ms. Souza estimated that hiring a contractor to seal leaks and install proper insulation would cost $7,000 to $10,000. I would qualify for roughly $2,000 in rebates, but ouch.', 'If I did the work, Ms. Souza said, my average winter bill would most likely drop to about $165 a month, from $250. More important, my wife, our dogs and I would live more comfortably.', 'In the end, tech options like smart thermostats are important and must-have products to help us fight surging energy costs. But they are just tools that give us deeper insight into our energy use. The real problem-solvers are still people, like you and your local HVAC professional.', '“Technology can significantly help you around your home, but it’s not a substitute for your own smarts,” said Mr. Brown of Google.']","['energy', 'home', 'bill', 'thermostat', 'winter', 'temperature', 'Nest', 'insulation', 'month', 'gas', 'cost', 'day', 'Souza', 'tech', 'schedule', 'price', 'electricity', 'house', 'furnace', 'device']",images/11.png

That supporter is being investigated for spreading disinformation and threatening Supreme Court judges.', 'Mr. de Moraes ordered internet and cell-service providers to make Telegram unusable in the country and directed Apple and Google to remove the app from their mobile app stores. He gave the companies five days to comply.', 'Mr. de Moraes has emerged as one of Mr. Bolsonaro’s biggest political opponents, overseeing a number of investigations and issuing court orders that target the president, his allies and his political strategy. Mr. Bolsonaro has struck back with sharp criticism of the judge, even vowing at a major political rally last year that he would not comply with his rulings.', 'While authoritarian countries like China regularly clamp down on internet platforms, blocking such a popular app across an entire country is highly unusual in a democracy like Brazil’s. But some authorities in Brazil, most notably the Supreme Court, have vowed to hold internet companies responsible for disinformation over concerns that they could influence October’s presidential elections.', 'In a statement late Friday, Pavel Durov, Telegram’s chief executive, said his company didn’t always respond to the Brazilian Supreme Court because Telegram missed the court’s emails.', '“I apologize to the Brazilian Supreme Court for our negligence. We definitely could have done a better job,” he said.', 'Mr. Durov asked the court to delay the ban “to allow us to remedy the situation by appointing a representative in Brazil and setting up a framework to react to future pressing issues like this in an expedited manner.”', 'In the order on Friday, Mr. de Moraes said he sent emails directly to Mr. Durov.', 'Telegram has become a hotbed of misinformation across the world, in part because it removes less content on its app than other social networks and includes features that make it easy to spread information far and fast. ', 'While WhatsApp, a main Telegram competitor, has made changes to limit the spread of misinformation — like limiting the size of group chats and the number of times a message can be forwarded — Telegram allows users to broadcast messages to thousands of people at once.', '“If Facebook is the heroin of disinformation, Telegram is the fentanyl,” said Sarah Oates, a University of Maryland professor who studies internet platforms.', 'Telegram’s hands-off approach has made the app particularly popular with right-wing users across the world who complain that the more mainstream social networks censor their views. In Brazil, Mr. Bolsonaro has urged his supporters to use Telegram instead of other social networks, and he has amassed nearly 1.1 million followers on the app. His top competitor in the 2020 presidential race, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has less than 50,000.', 'Telegram’s popularity on Brazil’s right has made it one of the country’s fastest-growing messaging apps. Since 2014, Telegram has been downloaded nearly 85 million times in Brazil, with 29 percent of those installations coming last year, according to Sensor Tower, an app data firm. By comparison, WhatsApp, the dominant app in Brazil, has been downloaded 677 million times in the country.', 'Amid growing concern over the spread of disinformation on social media, governments are increasingly grappling with how to regulate platforms, particularly in democracies where politicians are also eager to protect freedom of expression. The United States has taken a mostly hands-off approach. While former President Donald J. Trump tried to ban the Chinese apps WeChat and TikTok over national security concerns, the Biden administration later reversed the policy. China and Russia, meanwhile, have blocked apps like Facebook and Instagram.', 'Banning an app across an entire country is not technologically simple. Removing it from the Apple and Google app stores prevents additional people from downloading it, but the millions of people who already have the app — or who access it from a web browser — can continue to use the service.', 'Brazil’s approach is notable for how it seeks to force companies that provide the backbone of the internet to block Telegram’s web traffic. The policy even covers people who try to use software to get around the ban by routing their web traffic through other countries. Mr. de Moraes said anyone caught doing so would face a $20,000 fine.', 'The policy “is trying to attack from several fronts, so maybe it will be feasible,” said Lucas Lago, a Brazilian software researcher.', 'While misinformation is a tremendous concern on the platform, many major news outlets use Telegram to deliver content, including The New York Times.', 'Supporters of Mr. Bolsonaro immediately criticized the ban. Carla Zambelli, a Brazilian congresswoman and a longtime supporter of the president, said on Twitter that Telegram was “the only current tool in which we have freedom of expression” and called Mr. de Moraes a “tyrant.”', 'Senator Humberto Costa, a left-wing critic of Mr. Bolsonaro, said that “the Fake News Stock Market has plummeted. The Bolsonaros lost part of their heritage of lies.”', 'Representatives for Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. de Moraes did not respond to requests for comment. Apple and Google declined to comment.', 'Ms. Oates, the University of Maryland professor, said that Telegram had become well-known for ignoring government orders and requests for data. Yet she added that because Telegram was so overwhelmingly popular with the right wing in Brazil, the order could be perceived as a partisan move.', '“On the one hand, it’s understandable to want to regulate your media space, and platforms like this exacerbate existing problems,” she said. “On the other hand, it can be perceived as unfair because this targets a particular group of people.”', 'André Spigariol contributed reporting from Brasília, Brazil, and Leonardo Coelho from Rio de Janeiro.']","['Telegram', 'app', 'Brazil', 'country', 'de', 'Moraes', 'Bolsonaro', 'Court', 'Supreme', 'disinformation', 'people', 'order', 'supporter', 'internet', 'platform', 'court', 'company', 'concern', 'hand', 'wing']",images/16.png

After two years of supply chain chaos caused by the pandemic, the episode provided more evidence of how geopolitical tensions are destroying trading relationships that companies once took for granted, forcing them to rethink where they get the parts and metals they use to make cars and many other products.', 'Automakers and other companies that need nickel, as well as other battery raw materials like lithium or cobalt, have begun looking for ways to shield themselves against future shocks.', 'Volkswagen, for example, has begun to explore buying nickel directly from mining companies, Markus Duesmann, chief executive of the carmaker’s Audi division, said in an interview on Thursday. “Raw materials are going to be an issue for years to come,” he said.', 'The prospect of prolonged geopolitical tensions is likely to accelerate attempts by the United States and Europe to develop domestic supplies of commodities that often come from Russia. There are nickel deposits, for example, in Canada, Greenland and even Minnesota.', '“Nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium, even copper — we already realized we need those metals for the green transition, for mitigating climate change,” said Bo Stensgaard, chief executive of Bluejay Mining, which is working on extracting nickel from a site in western Greenland in a venture with KoBold Metals, whose backers include Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. “When you see the geopolitical developments with Ukraine and Russia, it’s even more obvious that there are supply risks with these metals.”', 'But establishing new mining operations is likely to take years, even decades, because of the time needed to acquire permits and financing. In the meantime, companies using nickel — a group that also includes steel makers — will need to contend with higher prices, which will eventually be felt by consumers.', 'An average electric-car battery contains about 80 pounds of nickel. The surge in prices in March would more than double the cost of that nickel to $1,750 a car, according to estimates by the trading firm Cantor Fitzgerald.', 'Russia accounts for a relatively small proportion of world nickel production, and most of it is used to make stainless steel, not car batteries. But Russia plays an outsize role in nickel markets. Norilsk Nickel, also known as Nornickel, is the world’s largest nickel producer, with vast operations in Siberia. Its owner, Vladimir Potanin, is one of Russia’s wealthiest people. Norilsk is among a limited number of companies authorized to sell a specialized form of nickel on the London Metal Exchange, which handles all nickel trading.', 'Unlike other oligarchs, Mr. Potanin has not been a target of sanctions, and the United States and Europe have not tried to block nickel exports, a step that would hurt their economies as well as Russia’s. The prospect that Russian nickel could be cut off from world markets was enough to cause panic.', 'Analysts expect prices to come down from their recent peaks but remain much higher than they were a year ago. “The trend would be to come down to a level close to where we last left off,” around $25,000 a metric ton compared to the peak of $100,000 a ton, said Adrian Gardner, a principal analyst specializing in nickel at Wood Mackenzie, a research firm.', 'Nickel was on a tear even before the Russian invasion as hedge funds and other investors bet on rising demand for electric vehicles. The price topped $20,000 a ton this year after hovering between $10,000 and $15,000 a ton for much of the past five years. At the same time, less nickel was being produced because of the pandemic.', 'After Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, the price rose above $30,000 in a little over a week. Then came March 8. Word spread on the trading desks of brokerage firms and hedge funds in London that a company, which turned out to be the Tsingshan Holding Group of China, had made a huge bet that the price of nickel would drop. When the price rose, Tsingshan owed billions of dollars, a situation known on Wall Street as a short squeeze.', 'The price shot up to a little over $100,000 a ton, threatening the existence of many other companies that had bet wrong and prompting the London Metal Exchange to halt trading.', 'Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes\xa0and spooking investors. The conflict has already caused\u200b\u200b dizzying spikes in energy prices,\xa0and could severely affect various countries and industries.', 'The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion. \xa0Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.', 'Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.', 'Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat;\xa0together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.', 'Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.', 'Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions\xa0intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.', 'The exchange tried to restart trading in nickel twice this week with new price limits, but sudden drops caused trading to halt once again. “The market is broken,” said Keith Wildie, the head of trading at the London-based metals firm Romco.', 'There is no sign that nickel prices will lead to factory shutdowns in the way that shortages of components made in Ukraine brought assembly lines at Volkswagen, BMW and other carmakers to a standstill. It will take a few weeks for price increases to ripple through the system.', 'For now, automakers and other big nickel buyers like steel makers may be able to find alternative suppliers, use more recycled material or switch to battery designs that require less nickel.', '“There is enough nickel,” Ola Källenius, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, said in an interview this week. But carmakers might have to pay more, he said, adding, “It’s not unlikely that we will have secondary effects from this conflict.”', ""The Ukraine conflict has underscored the urgency of moving away from fossil fuels, Mr. Duesmann of Audi said. Russian oil plays a much bigger role in the global economy than Russian nickel. “It would be too shortsighted to say, ‘Electromobility doesn’t work,'” he said."", 'Beyond the immediate disruption to supplies, automakers are concerned about a retreat from the open markets that have been so good for business.

The business was far from lucrative, but he was making about $200 a day before paying for costs like gas and car maintenance.', 'But as gas prices have risen in recent weeks, Mr. Potash has barely been breaking even. To compensate, he has focused on driving during peak customer hours and tried to fill up at cheaper gas stations in the area around San Francisco where he works. He has also reduced his driving time from about 45 hours each week to roughly 20 hours.', '“It hurts. I don’t have money coming in,” Mr. Potash, 48, said of his reduced hours. “But I’m not willing to operate at a loss.”', 'Gig workers who drive for ride-hailing and delivery companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have been hit hard by rising gas prices, because their ability to earn money is tied directly to driving hundreds of miles each week. And because the drivers are contract workers, the companies do not reimburse them for the cost of fueling up.', 'Some drivers say that they have had enough, and that the added cost of gas is making an already difficult financial equation untenable. The national average price of a gallon of gas peaked at a record $4.33 last week, according to AAA.

Lyft echoed that sentiment in a blog post on Monday.', 'DoorDash announced a gas rewards program on Tuesday.

Many such studies, the paper’s authors found, tend to include fewer than two dozen participants, far shy of the number needed to generate reliable results.', '“You need thousands of individuals,” said Scott Marek, a psychiatric researcher at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and an author of the paper. He described the finding as a “gut punch” for the typical studies that use imaging to try to better understand mental health.', 'Studies that use magnetic-resonance imaging technology commonly temper their conclusions with a cautionary statement noting the small sample size. But enlisting participants can be time-consuming and expensive, ranging from $600 to $2,000 an hour, said Dr. Nico Dosenbach, a neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine and another author on the paper. The median number of subjects in mental-health-related studies that use brain imaging is around 23, he added.', 'But the Nature paper demonstrates that the data drawn from just two dozen subjects is generally insufficient to be reliable and can in fact yield “massively inflated” findings,” Dr. Dosenbach said.', 'For their analysis, the researchers examined three of the largest studies using brain-imaging technology to reach conclusions about brain structure and mental health. All three studies are ongoing: the Human Connectome Project, which has 1,200 participants; the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development, or A.B.C.D., study, with 12,000 participants; and the U.K. Biobank study, with 35,700 participants.', 'The authors of the Nature paper looked at subsets of data within those three studies to determine whether smaller slices were misleading or “reproducible,” meaning that the findings could be considered scientifically valid.', 'For instance, the A.B.C.D. study looks, among other things, at whether thickness of the brain’s gray matter can be correlated to mental health and problem-solving ability. The authors of the Nature paper looked at small subsets within the big study and found that the subsets produced results that were unreliable when compared with the results yielded by the full data set.', 'On the other hand, the authors found, when results were generated from sample sizes involving several thousand subjects, the findings were similar to those from the full data set.', 'The authors ran millions of calculations by using different sample sizes and the hundreds of brain regions explored in the various major studies. Time and again, the researchers found that subsets of data from fewer than several thousand people did not produce results consistent with those of the full data set.', 'Dr. Marek said that the paper’s findings “absolutely” applied beyond mental health. Other fields, like genomics and cancer research, have had their own reckonings with the limits of small sample sizes and have tried to correct course, he noted.', '“My hunch this is much more about population science than it is about any one of those fields,” he said.']","['study', 'paper', 'brain', 'author', 'datum', 'finding', 'health', 'imaging', 'result', 'participant', 'size', 'sample', 'Nature', 'subset', 'researcher', 'technology', 'subject', 'conclusion', 'A.B.C.D.', 'University']",images/24.png

What comes next might be even more difficult.', 'Music was one of the first industries that felt the sonic boom of the internet, starting with song-sharing websites like Napster in the late 1990s and iTunes digital downloads later. This was thrilling for music lovers, but new ways to listen to and purchase (or not purchase) music pushed industry sales into a crater.', 'Now, thanks mostly to people paying for all-you-can-listen music streaming services like Spotify, music is financially healthy and reaches more people than ever. But all is not entirely well.', 'Even now, the music industry in the United States generates less revenue than at the peak of the CD. There’s a raging debate about how long the gravy train from streaming will last. And many musicians and others say that they’re not sharing in the spoils from the digital transformation.', 'I wanted this newsletter to answer a direct question: Is the music industry an internet success story or not? There is no simple answer, which shows how messy it can be when technology jolts an industry, and it might take decades for all participants to feel like winners of the digital revolution — if that’s even possible.', 'First, I’ll lay out the case that the music industry is doing awesome. More than 500 million people around the world pay for digital music, mostly in fees for services such as Spotify, Apple Music or Tencent Music, which is based in China. Those services have given the industry something it has never had before: a steady stream of cash every month.', 'The industry also is making money a gazillion ways. When you watch a music video on YouTube, money flows to the people responsible for that song. TikTok pays record companies when videos feature their popular songs. Maybe more than for books, movies or other conventional entertainment sources, there has been a powerful symbiosis of social media and music that has lifted the popularity of both.', 'That would have been difficult to predict when it seemed the internet was on a path to pulverize the industry. “It’s crazy that music is viewed as a success now,” Ben Sisario, my colleague who covers the music industry for The New York Times, told me. “The question now is, Can the growth continue?”', 'Ah, yes. The dark cloud. Revenue for the music industry has been increasing consistently since 2015, but revenue from all sources — including streaming subscriptions, CDs and royalties from elevator music — is still less than it was in 1999.', 'Total industry revenue back then was about $24 billion adjusted for inflation, and revenue in 2021 was $15 billion, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. (Global sales data from a different music trade group show a similar trajectory.)', 'There aren’t an infinite number of people who are willing to pay the going rate in many countries of $10 a month to access a whole bunch of songs on their phones via a service like Spotify. That’s what worries people who believe the music industry’s digital success has peaked.', 'Ben also told me that there’s anxiety in the industry that even the biggest songs or albums aren’t as popular as hits once were. There may be so much music and other entertainment at our fingertips that each fresh song simply is not as attention-getting or valuable as music was even a decade ago.', 'Ben has also written that 99 percent of artists — the ones who aren’t as famous as Beyoncé — tend to say that millions of streams of their songs might translate into pennies for them. If the music industry is a success, but so many musicians feel like they’re missing out … is that really success?', 'The pessimists could be wrong. People have also been saying for years that Netflix couldn’t keep adding paying customers, but it has, and now the entire entertainment industry is copying its strategy. Many musicians are excited about newer ways to reach fans on their own terms, including through the website Bandcamp and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, which are essentially a way to transform a digital good into something one of a kind.', 'But the combination of glory and anxiety in music reflects a running theme in this newsletter.

So he built a tiny photo booth (a sort of bee vestibule) that took pictures whenever something appeared around it. But sorting through thousands of insect portraits proved tedious.', 'Colleagues told him about a new product that the company was working on called Lobe.ai, which allows anybody to train a computer-vision system to recognize objects. Mr. Cusack used it to identify his honeybees — but also to keep an eye out for the dreaded Asian murder hornet.', '“It was just really simple,” Mr. Cusack said, adding that the underlying data science was “over my head,” despite his title. The Lobe platform allowed him to drag and drop sample photos and click a few buttons to make a system that could recognize his beloved bees and spot unwelcome visitors.', 'Mr. Cusack is part of a growing army of “citizen developers,” who use new products that allow anyone to apply artificial intelligence without having to write a line of computer code. Proponents of the “no-code” A.I. revolution believe it will change the world: It used to require a team of engineers to build a piece of software, and now users with a web browser and an idea have the power to bring that idea to life themselves.', '“We are trying to take A.I. and make it ridiculously easy,” said Craig Wisneski, a no-code evangelist and co-founder of Akkio, a start-up that allows anyone to make predictions using data.', 'A.I. is following a familiar progression. “First, it’s used by a small core of scientists,” Jonathan Reilly, Akkio’s other co-founder, said. “Then the user base expands to engineers who can navigate technical nuance and jargon until, finally, it’s made user-friendly enough that almost anyone can use it.”', 'Just as clickable icons have replaced obscure programming commands on home computers, new no-code platforms replace programming languages with simple and familiar web interfaces. And a wave of start-ups is bringing the power of A.I. to nontechnical people in visual, textual and audio domains.', 'Juji, for example, is a tool designed to make building A.I. chatbots as easy as creating a PowerPoint presentation. It uses machine learning to automatically handle complex conversation flows and infer users’ particular characteristics to personalize each engagement rather than simply serving up preprogrammed interactions.', 'Its co-founder, Michelle Zhou, said the goal was to give Juji chatbots advanced human soft skills such as emotional intelligence so that they could connect with users on a more human level than existing systems have. Using Juji, staff members at the University of Illinois were able to create and manage their custom A.I. chatbot and scale their student recruitment operations.', 'But not all of the existing tools are robust enough to do more than simple tasks. Google’s Teachable Machines is a computer-vision tool similar to Lobe.ai. Steve Saling, a former landscape architect who is now living with A.L.S., worked with the Teachable Machines team for about a year and a half to train a system to turn switches on and off using his facial expressions.', '“It gets more accurate with more data,” Mr. Saling said in an email. But he said the process of collecting that data — pictures of his face at different angles and in varying light — was labor intensive and the system never reached the level of accuracy required. “Automation needs to be in excess of 99 percent reliable to be dependent on it,” he said. “Teachable Machines will get there but it is not there yet.”', 'Still, it’s early days. “No-code A.I. tools are still on the fringes of the larger no-code movement, because not many people understand machine learning enough to dream up what’s possible,” said Josh Tiernan, who runs No Code Founders, a community of nontechnical entrepreneurs who use no-code tools such as WordPress or Bubble. But he expects no-code A.I. to grow as more people understand its potential.', 'Another force in no-code’s favor: Advances in A.I. itself are making no-code platforms more powerful. OpenAI, the company co-founded by Elon Musk, has a vast A.I. system, GPT-3, that can write code when prompted with simple English. It can even create websites and do other basic programming tasks. OpenAI has used the system to create GitHub Copilot, a tool that acts as an autocomplete function for coders, speeding up their work. DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has gone a step further with an A.I. tool capable of writing complete code to solve complex problems posed to it with normal speech or text.', 'Already, users of Microsoft’s Power Platform, which includes a family of no-code products, can generate simple applications by just describing them.', '“I could say something like, ‘Look up all the customer records from the last year,’ and it will go do that for you automatically,” said Charles Lamanna, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of business apps and platforms. He estimates that half of all office work could be automated with A.I. if there were enough developers to do the work. “The only way to do this is to empower everybody to be a no-code developer.”', 'Eventually the broader public will be able to create A.I.-enabled software in much the same way that teenagers today can create sophisticated video effects that would have required a professional studio a decade or two ago.', 'For now, though, most no-code-A.I. users are business professionals who want to streamline the way things are done without having to involve a programmer.', 'Google’s AppSheet, for example, is an open platform where people can connect data and, with a single click, create apps that can be opened on a smartphone, tablet or computer. It uses A.I. to understand the intent of users and enables them to build mobile and desktop applications with integrated computer vision and predictive analytics features. It costs nothing to make apps for personal use.', '“We’re focused on making this consumable by regular people,” said Praveen Seshadri, AppSheet’s co-founder and chief executive. There are many organizations around the world that have teams of people that need to coordinate schedules and tasks, he added. Each one is unique and more suited to building a custom app than trying to use something off the shelf.', 'As an example, he cited New Incentives, an organization that gives small amounts of cash to mothers in some of the poorest parts of Nigeria to encourage them to immunize their children. To track that data, they built an app with AppSheet that their employees now use in the field.', 'Alex Denning, who runs Ellipsis, a small marketing company for businesses that use WordPress, turned to Akkio to build an A.I. system that could predict which keyword and title would get his clients’ blog posts the most visibility on Google and other search engines. He dragged and dropped onto Akkio’s site a spreadsheet of past keywords and blog-post titles along with the number of clicks those posts got on Google. After a few keystrokes, Akkio created an A.I. to do the job.', '“Results for our clients improved by approximately a third as a result of leveraging Akkio and the A.I.,” Mr. Denning said. Once an A.I. system is created on Akkio, users can integrate with their existing software. Mr. Denning renamed the tool Falcon and uses it to market his company.', '“I am not a developer,” he said, “but it was easy and intuitive for me to make it happen.”', 'And Mr. Cusack, the bee guy?

So he called the state’s Horse Racing Board.', 'Mr. Soltani asked Scott Chaney, the executive director of the racing board, which oversees roughly 10 racetracks, about the ins and outs of running a small agency in California’s sprawling state government. They discussed how to handle remote work and hiring in the pandemic. Mr. Chaney also offered advice for navigating the public sector.', 'Mr. Soltani is “literally inventing a state department,” Mr. Chaney said. “He’s almost inventing it from the ground up.”', 'Mr. Soltani faces the daunting task of overseeing the first government body in the United States with the sole job of regulating how Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies collect and use data from millions of people. The office, the California Privacy Protection Agency, will be a more than 30-person group with a $10 million annual budget to help enforce the state’s privacy law, which is among the most stringent in the country.', 'But first the agency has to be built — and Mr. Soltani, 47, a privacy expert who once served as the Federal Trade Commission’s top technologist, has to overcome the lack of precedent. So he has reached out to groups not exactly adjacent to what his agency will be, like the racing board and others, for help navigating his new position.', 'He has already encountered challenges. He and his colleagues have received reams of feedback from industry lobbyists. They face questions from privacy activists about whether their budget is substantial enough to police the world’s largest companies. The board discussions need to be open to the public. And in the coming months, they must translate the feedback they have received into hard rules.', '“It’s easily the most difficult thing I’ve done in my life, but also I think potentially the most impactful,” said Mr. Soltani, who has been working from his home in Oakland, Calif.', 'The new California agency reflects a larger shift in how the rules of the global internet are being set — and who is setting them. State capitals and foreign countries are increasingly taking a hands-on approach to limiting online data collection, curtailing the tech giants’ power and moderating extreme content on social media.', 'They are filling a vacuum left by Congress. Lawmakers from both parties have long said they would support a national privacy law. But negotiations in Washington have stalled, partly because of a dispute over whether a federal law should supersede state laws. California, Colorado and Virginia have enacted privacy laws. Utah passed a privacy bill this month and other states are considering their own proposals.', 'Hayley Tsukayama, a legislative activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said lawmakers around the country were closely watching California’s developments.', '“We’re hearing from lawmakers who are looking at bills and saying, ‘Do we need a privacy agency?’” she said.', 'California’s Privacy Protection Agency stems from a 2018 state privacy law that gives residents the right to request their data from websites and have it deleted. The state attorney general was put in charge of creating rules under the law and suing companies that violated its terms. In 2020, privacy activists successfully campaigned to pass a ballot measure that added more provisions to the law and established the new agency to carry them out.', '“We have the opportunity to protect privacy, understanding how that interacts with all of the innovative technologies that we’ve built here in California,” said Jennifer Urban, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, whom Gov. Gavin Newsom tapped to lead the new agency’s five-member board.', 'The board began meeting last year to discuss building the Privacy Protection Agency from scratch. In October, it hired Mr. Soltani, who has won a Pulitzer Prize, as the agency’s executive director.', 'Mr. Soltani soon went on a listening tour. In addition to the horse racing regulator, he talked with California’s Department of Justice, its consumer finance regulator and the state medical board. He also spoke with contacts involved in setting up federal agencies.', 'Mr. Soltani initially worked with staff members who were borrowed from other state agencies. The agency’s acting top lawyer previously was at the Department of Motor Vehicles, where he helped write rules for autonomous vehicles.', 'Hiring is now a big focus for the agency. The agency has posted jobs for a permanent general counsel, a director of public affairs and a senior policy adviser. It has told the State Legislature that it hopes to pay roughly 34 employees in the coming year.', 'The effort has attracted global interest. Wojciech Wiewiorowski, the European Data Protection Supervisor, said he spoke with Mr. Soltani this year and saw the California agency — with Silicon Valley in its backyard — as a potentially fruitful ally to rein in the tech giants.', 'Mr. Soltani also discussed the agency with President Emmanuel Macron of France and other officials at a dinner last year in Paris.', 'Cédric O, France’s secretary of state for the digital economy, who attended the meeting, said the country was “following with great interest what’s happening in California.” He said that he had spoken with Mr. Soltani and that the two had compared notes on tech regulation.', 'California’s approach will test whether having an agency solely for policing online privacy can make the United States a tougher regulator of tech giants.', 'Dedicated data protection agencies are the norm in Europe, where they enforce the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates how websites can collect data from users. But reviews of how these groups have enforced the law have been mixed. Critics have said European governments lack the resources to take on Google, Amazon and others.', 'California faces similar doubts. The new agency’s $10 million annual budget pales in comparison with Google’s $76 billion in profit last year. And many tech companies that could be in its sights are enmeshed in the state’s economic fortunes and political machinations.', 'The agency “will be subject to a certain amount of political pressure,” said Tracy Rosenberg, the executive director of the nonprofit Media Alliance, a Bay Area public interest group, who also works with Oakland Privacy, a community group. “We don’t really know how the governor and Legislature are going to react if there is pushback because of actions the agency takes.”', 'The agency’s proponents said its independence was protected in part by its structure, with unpaid board members appointed separately by different elected officials. Mr. Soltani described the initial funding as “like the ante in a poker game” because voters have “bought in” for at least $10 million, but said the Legislature could give more.', 'The agency’s first task will be to turn the state privacy law, which is broad, into detailed regulations for industry. That runs the gamut, from how data is used for targeted ads to more novel areas of the law, like how algorithms use personal information to make automated decisions. The law also demands that businesses adhere to the privacy preferences that online users set in their browsers; it is up to the agency to decide what that means in practice.', 'Eventually, the agency will have the ability to enforce its rules. Businesses may also be required to submit audits of their cybersecurity risk to the agency. It has asked for input on what, exactly, those audits should include.', 'The agency has asked the public, nonprofits and businesses to submit comments to guide its initial rules. Privacy activists and industry groups have filed hundreds of pages of comments, trying to sway the agency’s decisions. Google, for example, asked the regulator to write rules that provide “flexibility for businesses to respond to consumer requests in a manner that prioritizes substance over form” and to line up with privacy laws in other states.', 'A Google spokesman, Jose Castaneda, said in a statement that the company advocated national privacy legislation and as “the California Privacy Protection Agency continues its work, we will continue to constructively engage to ensure we protect our users’ privacy.”', 'The Privacy Protection Agency’s board announced in February that it would hold workshops, likely this month, for more commentary from privacy experts and academics. At a meeting that month, Mr. Soltani said the group was likely to issue its first regulations later in the year so it could balance hiring a staff with the complex questions it had to address.', '“We’re building the car while we drive it,” he said.']","['agency', 'privacy', 'California', 'state', 'Soltani', 'law', 'board', 'Protection', 'group', 'rule', 'Privacy', 'year', 'Agency', 'company', 'regulator', 'datum', 'tech', 'month', 'activist', 'director']",images/30.png

Now, this area is at the vanguard of a new movement — people seeking to use only the energy they produce themselves.', 'Angry over blackouts, wildfires caused by utilities and rising electricity bills, a small but growing number of Californians in rural areas and in the suburbs of San Francisco are going off the grid. They can do so because of a stunning drop in the cost of solar panels and batteries over the last decade. Some homeowners who have built new, off-grid homes say they have even saved money because their systems were cheaper than securing a new utility connection.', 'There have long been free spirits and survivalists who have lived off the grid. But the decline in solar and battery costs and growing frustrations with utilities appear to be laying the groundwork for more people to consider doing so.', 'Nobody is quite sure how many off-grid homes there are but local officials and real estate agents said there were dozens here in Nevada County, a picturesque part of the Sierra Nevada range between Sacramento and Lake Tahoe. Some energy experts say that millions of people could eventually go off the grid as costs drop. A fully off-grid system in California can run from $35,000 to $100,000, according to installers. At the low end, such systems cost roughly as much as an entry-level Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck.', '“It’s not just the doomsayers or the eco-hippies,” said Diane Vukovic, who has researched the laws and regulations about going off the grid for Primal Survivor, an organization that helps consumers with disaster preparedness. “People want to have that self-reliance. It’s become so much cheaper and easier that at this point, there’s very little reason not to do it if you have the means to make the investment now.”', 'People going off the grid argue that utilities are not moving fast enough to address climate change and are causing other problems. In Northern California, Pacific Gas & Electric’s safety record has alienated many residents. The company’s equipment caused the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed dozens and destroyed the town of Paradise, about 70 miles north of Nevada City. The utility’s effort to prevent fires by cutting off power to homes and businesses has also angered people.', 'One of those residents is Alan Savage, a real estate agent in Grass Valley, who bought an off-grid home six years ago and has sold hundreds of such properties. He said he never loses power, unlike PG&E customers. “I don’t think I’ll ever go back to being on the grid,” Mr. Savage said.', 'For people like him, it is not enough to take the approach favored by most homeowners with solar panels and batteries. Those homeowners use their systems to supplement the electricity they get from the grid, provide emergency backup power and sell excess energy to the grid.', 'The appeal of off-grid homes has grown in part because utilities have become less reliable. As natural disasters linked to climate change have increased, there have been more extended blackouts in California, Texas, Louisiana and other states.', 'Californians are also upset that electricity rates keep rising and state policymakers have proposed reducing incentives for installing solar panels on homes connected to the grid. Installing off-grid solar and battery systems is expensive, but once the systems are up and running, they typically require modest maintenance and homeowners no longer have an electric bill.', 'RMI, a research organization formerly known as the Rocky Mountain Institute, has projected that by 2031 most California homeowners will save money by going off the grid as solar and battery costs fall and utility rates increase. That phenomenon will increasingly play out in less sunny regions like the Northeast over the following decades, the group forecasts.', 'David Hochschild, chairman of the California Energy Commission, a regulatory agency, said the state’s residents tend to be early adopters, noting that even a former governor, Jerry Brown, lives in an off-grid home. But Mr. Hochschild added that he was not convinced that such an approach made sense for most people. “We build 100,000 new homes a year in California, and I would guess 99.99 percent of them are connected to the grid,” he said.', 'Some energy experts worry that people who are going off the grid could unwittingly hurt efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That is because the excess electricity that rooftop solar panels produce will no longer reach the grid, where it can replace power from coal or natural gas plants. “We don’t need everybody to cut the cord and go it alone,” said Mark Dyson, senior principal with the carbon-free electricity unit of RMI.', 'Pepe Cancino moved from Santa Monica to Nevada County in 2020 after he and his wife, Diane, lost their jobs during the pandemic.

Another set of panels will sit atop their 2,100-square-foot home. They also have backup propane generators for snowy days.', 'The Cancinos went off the grid because hooking up to PG&E would have cost more than the $50,000 they spent on solar panels, batteries and generators.', 'Nevada County was founded in 1851 and stretches almost a thousand square miles with peaks as high as 5,000 feet above sea level. Black bears roam freely and a single snowfall can blanket the ground with three feet of powder.', 'Though the county leans liberal, interest in off-grid living bridges the partisan divide. Solar and batteries offer the self-reliance conservatives crave and the environmental benefits progressives seek.', 'But Scott Aaronson, a senior vice president for security and preparedness at the Edison Electric Institute, a utility industry trade group, said that while off-grid living might appeal to some, it was “like having a computer not connected to the internet.”', '“You’re getting some value but you’re not part of a greater whole,” he said. “When something goes wrong, that’s wholly on you.”', 'Some homeowners have lived without a grid connection for years but interest in cutting the cord surged after PG&E began to frequently use power shut-offs as a fire prevention tool in 2019, said Craig Griesbach, director of the Nevada County building department.', 'The county last year published a document to help homeowners go off the grid while complying with building codes. Mr. Griesbach said officials from as far as Los Angeles had contacted his office for advice on off-grid rules.', '“Fifteen or 20 years ago, you wouldn’t have been able to do this,” he said.', 'PG&E said homeowners in rural areas like Nevada County had always been more likely to go off the grid because extending power lines over long distances simply costs more.', 'A decade or two back, off-grid homes included a patchwork of solar panels, diesel or propane generators and lead acid batteries. A system that could run a furnace, a refrigerator and washer and dryer could cost well over $100,000.', 'Most current off-grid systems rely heavily on solar panels because their cost has fallen to less than $4 a watt from about $11.40 a watt in 2000, not including state and federal incentives, according the California Solar and Storage Association. Lithium-ion batteries weighing as little as 30 pounds, requiring minimal maintenance and costing $10,000 to $20,000 have replaced banks of lead acid batteries that used to cost tens of thousands of dollars, could weigh thousands of pounds and needed regular upkeep. Generators are often used but serve mostly as an emergency backup, as they do for homes connected to the grid, said Aaron Schroeder, who installed the systems used by the Cancinos.', 'Off-grid systems are particularly attractive to people building new homes. That’s because installing a 125- to 300-foot overhead power line to a new home costs about $20,000, according to the California Public Utilities Commission. In places where lines have to be buried, installation runs about $78,000 for 100 feet.', 'That’s why Wim Coekaerts went off the grid in his 2,800-square-foot home in Woodside, near Stanford University.', 'His plot sits just across the street from homes that are connected to PG&E. But the utility told him it would cost $100,000 for new electric service, and building a trench for the line, based on regulatory estimates, could add $300,000 or more. So he spent $300,000 after federal tax credits on solar panels and a large battery.', 'After a year of living in the house, Mr. Coekaerts, an executive at Oracle, is happy with his choice. While his neighbors on PG&E have lost power three times, he said, he hasn’t gone without it “even for a nanosecond.”', '“When it was really bad weather the first time, I was nervous,” said Mr. Coekaerts, a native of Belgium who moved to the United States in 1997. “Now I feel comfortable.”', 'He has never had to ration his use of appliances and has had no problems charging two Teslas. He has been producing so much electricity that he started mining Bitcoin.', 'His system cost a lot because he bought a very large battery to soak up energy from solar panels for use when the sun isn’t shining. But electric cars may soon play that role, making it cheaper to go off the grid.', 'Electric cars available now aren’t designed to send power to homes. But newer models like the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Hyundai Ioniq 5 will have that ability, said Bill Powers, a San Diego engineer who plans to go off the grid with the help of an electric car. “The Holy Grail to me now is in electric vehicles.”']","['grid', 'home', 'battery', 'system', 'panel', 'power', 'California', 'utility', 'homeowner', 'people', 'Nevada', 'year', 'electricity', 'energy', 'foot', 'cost', 'County', 'PG&E', 'state', 'line']",images/32.png

That’s because installing a 125- to 300-foot overhead power line to a new home costs about $20,000, according to the California Public Utilities Commission. In places where lines have to be buried, installation runs about $78,000 for 100 feet.', 'That’s why Wim Coekaerts went off the grid in his 2,800-square-foot home in Woodside, near Stanford University.', 'His plot sits just across the street from homes that are connected to PG&E. But the utility told him it would cost $100,000 for new electric service, and building a trench for the line, based on regulatory estimates, could add $300,000 or more. So he spent $300,000 after federal tax credits on solar panels and a large battery.', 'After a year of living in the house, Mr. Coekaerts, an executive at Oracle, is happy with his choice. While his neighbors on PG&E have lost power three times, he said, he hasn’t gone without it “even for a nanosecond.”', '“When it was really bad weather the first time, I was nervous,” said Mr. Coekaerts, a native of Belgium who moved to the United States in 1997. “Now I feel comfortable.”', 'He has never had to ration his use of appliances and has had no problems charging two Teslas. He has been producing so much electricity that he started mining Bitcoin.', 'His system cost a lot because he bought a very large battery to soak up energy from solar panels for use when the sun isn’t shining. But electric cars may soon play that role, making it cheaper to go off the grid.', 'Electric cars available now aren’t designed to send power to homes. But newer models like the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Hyundai Ioniq 5 will have that ability, said Bill Powers, a San Diego engineer who plans to go off the grid with the help of an electric car. “The Holy Grail to me now is in electric vehicles.”']","['grid', 'home', 'battery', 'system', 'panel', 'power', 'California', 'utility', 'homeowner', 'people', 'Nevada', 'year', 'electricity', 'energy', 'foot', 'cost', 'County', 'PG&E', 'state', 'line']",images/45.png

Many people choose to display their NFTs as their profile picture on social media accounts. ', '(And if you’re wondering how ownership of a digital asset can be proven: Every NFT, or non-fungible token, has a distinct serial number, and the transaction history of each NFT is stored on the blockchain, so people can see who the real owner is.)', 'Mr. Pollak, 29, who bought three more a few months later, obtained these from a collection of 10,000 NFTs known as the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Some of the apes are wearing gold jackets or animal-print tunics. Others are smoking cigars or smiling widely. ', 'At the time, Mr. Pollak, who works for Genies, a tech start-up in Los Angeles that makes NFTs and avatars, didn’t have a lot of disposable income. “I was living in a four-bedroom townhouse with three other people,” he said. “We all shared a bathroom. It felt like college life.” ', 'He didn’t come from money, either. During the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Pollak said, when he was 16, his mother couldn’t pay the mortgage, so he and his family had to rent an apartment.', 'Mr. Pollak’s interest in NFTs was spurred by hearing people talk about them on Clubhouse. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is insane. I’m about to spend hundreds of dollars on a picture of a monkey,’” he said.', 'Turns out it was a wise decision. Last fall, several months after he had bought his first NFTs, Mr. Pollak’s apes skyrocketed in value. He sold one that he had bought for approximately 14 Ether (a virtual currency that was worth about $40,000 on the day of the purchase) for around 70 Ether (approximately $231,000 on the day of sale). ', 'He used the money for a down payment on a three-bedroom house in Los Angeles with a backyard. “We call it the Chimp Chalet,” he said, laughing. “I always wanted to own a house but never thought I could make it work.”', 'He now has three Bored Ape NFTs in his portfolio. He hasn’t sold them yet, but he will one day. For the first time in his life he feels financially well-off.', 'A fortunate handful of people now have their very own rags-to-riches stories thanks to NFTs. By investing in the right project at the right time, some collectors and digital artists have made “life-changing money,” said Matt Medved, a founder of Nft Now, a digital media publication about NFTs. Some are using the funds to pay off student loans, buy a home or quit jobs they hated. (Some people, of course, are also buying yachts or throwing lavish parties.)', '“NFTs are like manna from heaven,” said Mr. Pollak, who also acknowledges how lucky he is. “I’ve heard horror stories of people spending their rent money on NFTs. It’s heartbreaking to see people risk their money when it doesn’t usually work out.”', 'Most people who make or buy NFTs never turn a profit. There is no regulation or consumer protection, and trading them is basically as risky as gambling. Investing in cryptocurrency is high risk and involves a lot of technical know-how and luck; few financial professionals would recommend it, and scams are aplenty.', 'Mr. Medved encourages people to think of NFTs like baseball cards. “For generations our society has accepted that rare baseball cards have value,” he said. “There is a rare Mickey Mantle card that probably costs 5 cents to make that sold for $5.2 million last year. And why? It’s not about the physical piece of card stock. It’s the history, the rarity, the scarcity, the cultural relevance.”', '“It comes down to fandom,” he added.', 'Similarly, what many NFT artists create or collectors invest in will be worth little or nothing in the long term. But there are a few NFTs that have become very valuable and have earned their owners and creators a vast sum of money in a short period of time.', 'The Bored Apes that Mr. Pollak bought, for example, could be minted — i.e. go to market — at .08 Ether ($200 last spring). Now, less than a year later, the cheapest one is worth about 73 Ether (about $190,000). (Ether can be converted to cash on major cryptocurrency platforms like Coinbase and Gemini and then transferred to a bank account.)', 'Claire Silver, an artist in her early 30s who works with artificial intelligence, is another NFT success story. In 2017, she was given three CryptoPunks, a collection of 10,000 unique pixel art characters generated from an algorithm, by someone she met on Slack. ', '“I was in a chat room about cryptocurrency, and I met this guy who was interested in art,” said Ms. Silver, who lives a nomadic lifestyle but most recently lived in Denver. He told her he had 730 CryptoPunks, she said, “and asked if I wanted three. I said, ‘Sure.’”', 'In 2017, collectors could claim CryptoPunks for free as long as they had an Etherum wallet. Now the cheapest one is selling for around 68 Ether (almost $175,000).', 'She held on to hers until 2020 when she heard rumblings that they were selling for a lot of money. She sold one in July 2021 for about $60,000 and still has two others. (Many are selling for six figures. One sold last month for almost $600,000.) ', 'Ms. Silver also makes her own NFTs. She, like all NFT artists, earns money from the original sale and may receive 10 percent of every secondary sale. One of her pieces sold for 15 Ether ($63,000 at the time).', 'She has saved so much that she finally feels financially secure, at least for now. “This amount of money is a big deal to me because I come from poverty. We had to accept church donations for food growing up,” she said. “The other day I walked into Walmart and was like, ‘I can buy the cheese, I can buy the good coffee.’ I had never experienced that freedom before.” ', 'She recently returned from a trip to Britain, where Sotheby’s was auctioning her work, and has a trip planned to Japan. ', 'This month she is even giving her mother a house, which she paid for in all cash. “I got one of those big red bows, and I am going to stick it on the front door like in those commercials,” she said. “I have been wanting to do something like this for my mom since I was a little kid.”', 'A glossary. Cryptocurrencies\xa0have gone from a curiosity to a viable investment, making them almost impossible to ignore. If you are struggling with the terminology, let us help:', 'Bitcoin.

NFTs make digital artworks\xa0unique, and therefore sellable.', 'Only two years ago Alex Lugo, 29, who lives in Lindenhurst, N.Y., drove trucks to support his wife and two children, 9 and 5. “I was making $25 an hour,” he said. “That’s nothing in New York.” He decided to enroll in a program to learn how to trade in cryptocurrency, and it changed his family’s life.', 'While some collectors buy select NFTs and hold on to them for years, he flips many in the short term. “I ended up buying them and flipping some of them for 10K, some for 30K, some for 5K, 2K,” he said.', 'He has also benefited from investing in newer types of NFTs. “I own real estate in the Metaverse next to the Adidas headquarters,” he said. “It’s like owning real estate in the Hamptons, because what is Adidas going to do when they want to expand? They are going to buy me out and pay me millions of dollars so I will move.”', '(“This sounds speculative rather than anything that could be easily proven,” Mr. Medved said in an email.) ', 'Mr. Lugo made enough money from these individual sales that he quit his truck driving job in January 2021. Now, he says he has been able to tuck away a significant amount of savings for his children, who will “have the freedom to choose what they want to do with their lives.”', 'He and his family currently live in a two-bedroom apartment, but he is looking to buy a four-bedroom house in Lindenhurst.', 'NFTs have helped others dig themselves out of financial holes and get a new start.', 'Gossamer Farris, 32, is now a full-time artist in Brooklyn. But it took NFTs to get her there comfortably.', 'After college she worked a 9 to 5 job at a student loan servicing center. “I was doing art as much as I could after work,” she said. “I was making illustrations and sculptures and textile work, and I was also making items like little stickers that people could buy in my online store.” ', 'In 2019, she quit that job to become a tattoo artist, but even that was a struggle, especially in the early months of the pandemic. “I had a hard time making ends meet,” she said. “Unfortunately I had a lot of debt like credit card debt and health-related debt because I am a transgender person and had surgery.”', 'In the winter of 2021 she saw people were going crazy for NFTs, and she decided to try to make her own collections, with work that focuses on her Filipino and Black heritage, and collaborate with other artists on their NFTs. ', 'She has since paid off her debt, and now makes enough money through NFTs that she can pursue her passions exclusively. “I don’t have the stress that I need to make money as an artist,” she said. “I can pay the rent and not have to worry about making ends meet.”', 'While some people are getting rich off NFTs, Mr. Medved advises people to remember that many other NFT projects lose value over time. “You should never invest any more money than you are willing to lose,” he said. “The NFT space, like the crypto space, is very volatile, and the markets go up and down very quickly.”', '“I do think a lot of NFTs will end up going to zero in the long run,” he said. “Your success depends on your ability to pick the best projects, and that isn’t easy.”']","['people', 'nfts', 'money', 'NFT', 'artist', 'Pollak', 'time', 'ape', 'month', 'life', 'lot', 'currency', 'card', 'cryptocurrency', 'collector', 'job', 'transaction', 'house', 'day', 'sale']",images/46.png

He began a campaign to rally support from multinational businesses to sunder Russia from the world economy and to cut off the country from the global internet, taking aim at everything from access to new iPhones and PlayStations to Western Union money transfers and PayPal.', 'To achieve Russia’s isolation, Mr. Fedorov, a former tech entrepreneur, used a mix of social media, cryptocurrencies and other digital tools. On Twitter and other social media, he pressured Apple, Google, Netflix, Intel, PayPal and others to stop doing business in Russia. He helped form a group of volunteer hackers to wreak havoc on Russian websites and online services. His ministry also set up a cryptocurrency fund that has raised more than $60 million for the Ukrainian military.', 'The work has made Mr. Fedorov one of Mr. Zelensky’s most visible lieutenants, deploying technology and finance as modern weapons of war. In effect, Mr. Fedorov is creating a new playbook for military conflicts that shows how an outgunned country can use the internet, crypto, digital activism and frequent posts on Twitter to help undercut a foreign aggressor.', 'In his first in-depth interview since the invasion began on Feb. 24, Mr. Fedorov said his goal was to create a “digital blockade” and to make life so unpleasant and inconvenient for Russian citizens that they would question the war. He praised companies that had pulled out of Russia, but said Apple, Google and others could go further with steps such as completely cutting off their app stores in the country.', 'A technological and business blockade, he said, “is an integral component of stopping the aggression.”', 'Mr. Fedorov, speaking via videoconference from an undisclosed location somewhere around Kyiv, also brushed off concerns that his actions were alienating urban Russians who might be the most likely to oppose the conflict.', '“We believe that as long as Russians are silent that they are complicit to the aggression and to the killing of our people,” he said.', 'Mr. Fedorov’s work is not the only reason that multinational companies like Meta and McDonald’s have withdrawn from Russia, with the war’s human toll provoking horror and outrage. Economic sanctions by the United States, European Union and others have played a central role in isolating Russia.', 'But Peter Singer, a professor at the Center on the Future of War at Arizona State University, said Mr. Fedorov had been “incredibly effective” in calling for companies to rethink their Russia connections.', '“No celebrity, let alone nation, has ever been more effective than Ukraine at calling out corporate brands to name and shame them into acting morally,” Mr. Singer said. “If there is such a thing as ‘cancel culture,’ the Ukrainians can claim to have honed it in war.”', 'In the 45-minute interview on Zoom, Mr. Fedorov, wearing a loosefitting gray fleece with black zippers, sat in front of a wood-paneled wall. He has gotten about three to four hours of sleep a night, he said, often interrupted every 30 minutes or so by alerts on the iPhone that he keeps next to his bed. He said he has been worried about his father, who has been in intensive care for the past week after a missile struck the house next door.', '“I’ve brushed shoulders with the horror,” he said. “The war has come knocking on my door as well personally.”', 'Mr. Fedorov grew up in the small town of Vasylivka in southern Ukraine near the Dnieper River. Before going into politics, he started a digital marketing company called SMMSTUDIO that designed online advertising campaigns.', ""The work led him to a job in 2018 with Mr. Zelensky, then an actor who was making an unexpected run for Ukraine’s presidency. Mr. Fedorov became the campaign's director of digital, using social media to portray Mr. Zelensky as a youthful symbol of change."", 'After Mr. Zelensky was elected in 2019, he appointed Mr. Fedorov, then 28, to be minister of digital transformation, putting him in charge of digitizing Ukrainian social services.

Last year, Mr. Fedorov visited Silicon Valley to meet with leaders including Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple.', 'After Russia invaded Ukraine, Mr. Fedorov immediately pressured tech companies to pull out of Russia. He made the decision with Mr. Zelensky’s backing, he said, and the two men speak every day.', '“I think this choice is as black and white as it ever gets,” Mr. Fedorov said. “It is time to take a side, either to take the side of peace or to take the side of terror and murder.”', 'On Feb. 25, he sent letters to Apple, Google and Netflix, asking them to restrict access to their services in Russia. Less than a week later, Apple stopped selling new iPhones and other products in Russia.', 'The next day, Mr. Fedorov tweeted a message to Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, asking for help in obtaining Starlink satellite internet systems that are made by Mr. Musk’s company SpaceX. The technology could help Ukrainians stay online even if Russia damaged the country’s main telecommunications infrastructure. Two days after contacting Mr. Musk, a shipment of Starlink equipment arrived in Ukraine.', 'Since then, Mr. Fedorov said he has periodically exchanged text messages with Mr. Musk.', 'Mr. Fedorov also had a call last month with Karan Bhatia, a Google vice president. Google has since made several changes, including restricting access to certain Google Maps features that Mr. Fedorov said were safety risks because they could help Russian soldiers identify crowds of people. The company has since then also suspended sales of other products and services, and, on Friday blocked access to Russian state media globally on YouTube.', 'Mr. Fedorov has traded emails with Nick Clegg, the head of global affairs at Meta, which is the parent of Facebook and Instagram, about the unfolding war.', 'Apple, Google and Meta declined to comment. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Public shaming has been effective, Mr. Fedorov said, because companies are “emotional as well as rational in decision making.”', 'Russian forces appear stalled. With Russia’s advance on Ukraine’s major cities stalled and satellite imagery showing soldiers digging into defensive positions around Kyiv, a consensus is emerging in the West that the war has reached a bloody stalemate.', 'Mariupol is still suffering. Russian forces continued to bombard the besieged coastal city, hitting a\xa0drama school\xa0where 400 people were hiding, according to local officials. The city’s mayor said thousands of residents had been forcibly deported to Russia.', 'A Ukrainian base is hit. A missile attack on barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv killed more than 40 marines, a Ukrainian official said. That would make it one of the single deadliest attacks on Ukrainian forces since the start of the war, and the death toll could be much higher.', 'Putin does not want direct negotiations.

Putin of Russia in the hope of ending the war, but Mr. Putin does not think the time is right for talks, according to a senior Turkish official.', 'But while many companies have halted business in Russia, more could be done, he said. Apple and Google should pull their app stores from Russia and software made by companies like SAP was also being used by scores of Russian businesses, he has noted.', 'In many instances, the Russian government is cutting itself off from the world, including blocking access to Twitter and Facebook. On Friday, Russian regulators said they would also restrict access to Instagram and called Meta an “extremist” organization.', 'Some civil society groups have questioned whether Mr. Fedorov’s tactics could have unintended consequences. “Shutdowns can be used in tyranny, not in democracy,” the Internet Protection Society, an internet freedom group in Russia, said in a statement earlier this week. “Any sanctions that disrupt access of Russian people to information only strengthen Putin’s regime.”', 'Mr. Fedorov said it was the only way to jolt the Russian people into action.

So Why Isn’t It Booming?,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/technology/bitcoin-ukraine-russia-roose.html,"['For years, Bitcoin buffs who were questioned by skeptics about the value of the cryptocurrency would respond by saying: just wait.', 'Wait until inflation hits, and people look to park their savings in a stable digital asset that won’t lose its value. Wait until war breaks out, and authoritarians start seizing assets and imposing capital controls on their citizens. Wait until big banks and tech companies start censoring dissidents for their political views. Then you’ll see why we need a stateless, decentralized, anonymous digital currency.', 'More than most cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin was seen by many of its libertarian-leaning fans as a kind of doomsday insurance, a form of “digital gold” that would be a source of stability as the world grew more chaotic and unpredictable.', 'Well, chaos is here. In the United States, inflation is rising at the fastest pace in decades, and the VIX — the so-called fear index used by Wall Street to measure expected volatility in the stock market — has risen more than 80 percent this year. Last month, Canada’s government responded to the threat of a protest convoy of anti-vaccine truckers by threatening to freeze their bank accounts, drawing calls for a type of money that isn’t subject to government seizures. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was met with brutal sanctions that have tanked the ruble and devastated the Russian economy, and many U.S. companies have pulled out of Russia, making it nearly impossible for its citizens to access their bank accounts, use credit cards or even post on social media.', 'In other words, this is a perfect storm of economic and geopolitical events that should, theoretically, be great for Bitcoin.', 'But Bitcoin hasn’t boomed. In fact, even as Wall Street analysts contemplate the possibility of nuclear Armageddon, crypto prices have fallen steadily. Bitcoin prices are down 10 percent in the past month, and Ether, the second most popular crypto coin, is down roughly 15 percent.', 'Day-to-day usage of cryptocurrencies isn’t picking up the way you’d expect, either. Bitcoin trading volume rose after Russia invaded Ukraine, but it has remained relatively flat since, suggesting that people aren’t rushing to trade their rubles and hryvnia (Ukraine’s currency) for digital currencies. Russian oligarchs don’t appear to be using crypto to evade sanctions en masse, either, despite initial fears that they might.', 'Granted, crypto has not been totally absent from these events. In Canada, some truckers raised money through crypto donations (while others had their crypto wallets seized as part of the crackdown), and Ukraine’s government has reportedly raised nearly $100 million in crypto donations. And it’s still too early to say, with certainty, that crypto won’t be useful in later stages of the Russian conflict.', 'But Bitcoin doesn’t seem to be playing a central role in our global unraveling so far. Which raises the obvious question: Why not?', 'One possibility is that crypto is still too confusing and too difficult for normal people to use, especially during a war. Internet access is spotty in many parts of Ukraine, and reports have suggested that even the country’s elites are struggling to convert their assets into crypto.', 'Another possibility, popular among skeptics of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is that Bitcoin is still too volatile to be useful as a hedge against economic and political instability.', '“The Bitcoin and crypto communities have been selling a false narrative all these years that Bitcoin is supposed to be a safe haven from the traditional financial markets,” said Jimmy Nguyen, the president of the Bitcoin Association, a cryptocurrency trade group. (His group promotes a Bitcoin spinoff, Bitcoin SV, that sees itself as a more useful version of the cryptocurrency.)', 'Bitcoin is doomed, Mr. Nguyen argues, because it can be slow and expensive to process transactions, making it less useful for paying for things. “And so a lot of Bitcoin supporters have had to come up with this argument that it’s meant to be a reserve asset,” he said.', 'Kevin Werbach, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, floated a different theory. Bitcoin’s earliest and most vocal adopters, he said, tended to be libertarians who saw cryptocurrency as a kind of insurance policy against hyperinflation and government corruption. But the more recent price swings in the crypto markets attracted a surge of speculators who viewed Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mainly as investments, and cared less about their political implications.', '“There’s a tremendous amount of rhetoric around Bitcoin in particular that suggests that it’s predominantly a means of escaping from the government-issued fiat currency system,” he said. “And yet most of the activity, according to basically every rigorous study that’s been done, is predominantly people speculating.”', 'Russian forces appear stalled. With Russia’s advance on Ukraine’s major cities stalled and satellite imagery showing soldiers digging into defensive positions around Kyiv, a consensus is emerging in the West that the war has reached a bloody stalemate.', 'Mariupol is still suffering. Russian forces continued to bombard the besieged coastal city, hitting a\xa0drama school\xa0where 400 people were hiding, according to local officials. The city’s mayor said thousands of residents had been forcibly deported to Russia.', 'A Ukrainian base is hit. A missile attack on barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv killed more than 40 marines, a Ukrainian official said. That would make it one of the single deadliest attacks on Ukrainian forces since the start of the war, and the death toll could be much higher.', 'Putin does not want direct negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly called for direct negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the hope of ending the war, but Mr. Putin does not think the time is right for talks, according to a senior Turkish official.', 'Another possible explanation for Bitcoin’s underperformance, which was floated by Joe Weisenthal at Bloomberg, is that chaos cuts both ways, and that the same events that could be seen as “good for Bitcoin” in the short term — inflation, sanctions, geopolitical conflict — could also be bad for Bitcoin over the long term, since they could draw the attention of regulators.', '“To whatever extent the Canadian trucker story would be seen as bullish for Bitcoin (because it got people thinking about ways of making payments without regulated entities) it’s also bearish for Bitcoin (because it caught the attention of state actors who wanted to push back against such payments),” he wrote.', 'There are other explanations out there, too. Sam Bankman-Fried, the chief executive of crypto exchange FTX, said on Twitter that while he thought Bitcoin would “do better” in a less stable political and economic environment, he guessed that the discrepancy was partially related to the media’s negative coverage of crypto.', '“Headlines have been largely negative independent of actual content the last month in a reaction to statements from the industry, which I think has posed significant headwinds,” he wrote.', 'But perhaps the most interesting view of crypto’s usefulness during unstable times comes straight from Ukraine’s government.', 'On Tuesday, I posed a question about crypto to Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation. Since the Russian invasion, Mr. Bornyakov and his team — led by the country’s digital minister, Mykhailo Fedorov — have been working around the clock to coordinate crypto donations for Ukraine’s army. Tens of millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies have been sent to these addresses, and the money has been used to buy military supplies, including bulletproof vests and night-vision goggles.', 'Mr. Bornyakov, who was speaking from an undisclosed location in Ukraine on a video conference hosted by the artificial intelligence company Collective[i], said that one advantage of using crypto to raise money was how quickly the funds could be disbursed.', '“In a situation like this, where the national bank is not fully operating, crypto is helping to perform fast transfers, to make it very quick and get results almost immediately,” he said.', 'But Mr. Bornyakov seemed wary of overstating crypto’s importance to the Ukrainian cause.', '“I don’t think crypto is playing a major part,” Mr. Bornyakov said. “But its role is essential in this conflict in terms of helping our army.”']","['Ukraine', 'crypto', 'Bitcoin', 'government', 'people', 'Russia', 'cryptocurrencie', 'war', 'Bornyakov', 'money', 'cryptocurrency', 'currency', 'city', 'bank', 'asset', 'sanction', 'percent', 'Putin', 'bitcoin', 'event']",images/51.png

Her request had been challenged — by Apple.', 'In a 246-page opposition filing, lawyers for the iPhone maker wrote that Ms. St. John’s logo was “likely to tarnish Apple’s reputation, which Apple has cultivated in part by endeavoring not to associate itself with overtly sexual or pornographic material.”', 'Ms. St. John, 41, a human resources professional in Chandler, Ariz., was crestfallen.

That’s more than the estimated 136 trademark oppositions that Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google collectively filed in the same period, the group said.', 'Apple is a more common word than corporate names like Microsoft or Google, and the high rate stems partly from that. Many copycats, particularly in China, have also tried drafting off Apple’s name or logo in the tech and entertainment industries to make a buck.', 'But Apple has frequently targeted entities that have nothing to do with tech or that are infinitesimal in size. It has even set its sights on logos that involve other fruits, like oranges and pears.', 'Its quarries have included an Indian food blog, the Energy Department, a Wisconsin public school district and Mattel, which makes the hit card game Apples to Apples. Apple also objected to an orange logo used by a curbside pickup start-up named Citrus. Last year, it settled a dispute with a meal planning app called Prepear after the app’s creator agreed to change a leaf on its pear logo to make it look less like Apple’s.', 'The scale of the company’s campaign amounts to “bullying tactics, and they are unnecessary for Apple to protect the public from confusion,” said Christine Farley, a professor at American University’s Washington College of Law.', 'Citrus; the Energy Department; Super Healthy Kids, the company behind Prepear; and the Patent and Trademark Office declined to comment. Mattel did not respond to requests for comment.', 'Josh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman, said the law “requires” that the company protect its trademarks by filing oppositions with the Patent and Trademark Office if there are concerns with new trademark applications.', '“When we see applications that are overly broad or could be confusing to our customers, our first step is always to reach out and try to resolve these quickly and amicably,” he said. “Legal action is always our last resort.”', 'Apple files trademark oppositions against entities that have already received logo or name approval from the Patent and Trademark Office.

On a call with Wall Street analysts on Thursday, R.J. Scaringe, Rivian’s chief executive, said the problems centered on a “small number of parts.”', 'Rivian makes a high-end truck — designed more as an off-road vehicle than as a cargo hauler — and a sport utility vehicle. Rivian also has an agreement to make electric delivery vans for a big shareholder, Amazon, which has ordered 100,000. When Rivian went public, investors saw it as a possible competitor to Tesla, the largest electric vehicle maker.', 'Rivian said that as of Tuesday, it had produced 1,410 vehicles this year, a small fraction of the 83,000 orders submitted. The company did not say how many vans it had delivered to Amazon this year.', 'Stock analysts said Rivian’s report was disappointing, and its stock plunged 12 percent in after-hours trading after the company released its results.', '“It’s been a very frustrating name,” said Dan Ives, analyst and managing director at Wedbush Securities, “and these results show that Rivian still has a lot more wood to chop.” He said he had originally expected Rivian to make 40,000 vehicles this year, well above the company’s latest forecast, adding that analysts had expected orders for Rivian vehicles to be higher than the 83,000 reported.', 'Along with other E.V. makers, Rivian must contend with rising prices for lithium and nickel, which are used in making batteries. Russia is a big exporter of nickel, and fears that the metal’s supply could be constrained have driven up its price.', '“We hope the inflation that we’ve seen with nickel pricing very recently is short-lived,” Mr. Scaringe said.', 'Rivian went public in November, raising $13.5 billion — cash it will need to expand its factory in Normal, Ill., and build one in Georgia. The stock soared at first, giving Rivian a market value exceeding that of General Motors, but it is now trading at roughly half its I.P.O. price.', 'The shares declined in recent months after Rivian said it was facing production challenges, then tumbled further in a customer relations debacle over pricing. Rivian said last week that it would increase the prices of its vehicles, even those already ordered. Facing a backlash, Rivian backtracked and applied the increases only to new orders, and Mr. Scaringe apologized in a letter to customers.', 'Before the price change, Rivian’s truck and car could cost as much as $83,000. After the introduction of new offerings, the price could reach $95,000.', 'Rivian had revenue of $55 million last year and a net loss of $4.7 billion. It used up $4.4 billion of cash running its business and investing in new facilities and equipment, and had $18 billion of cash on its balance sheet at the end of last year. The company said it expected a loss this year of $4.75 billion under a measurement of profits known as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.', 'Mr. Ives said investors might also balk at the high level of costs, especially if they were expecting higher order numbers. “The cost overruns are a lot more than the Street expected,” he said. “If preorders were on pace, the Street would be fine with it.”', 'The executive overseeing Rivian’s operations left last year as the company was trying to ramp up production.

The shaking quickly overwhelmed the seismometer, an education instrument installed at a high school, and it recorded little useful data.', 'Weeks passed before foreign seismic experts could travel to the disaster area, and then months passed before the portable seismometers they installed recorded enough of the fading aftershocks to shed light on the fault that had ruptured.', 'Last August, a magnitude-7.2 earthquake struck Haiti. Conventional seismometers installed after the 2010 quake were not functioning at the time. But several small, inexpensive instruments run by citizen scientists managed to capture the seismic waves, giving researchers a much quicker view of where the Earth had broken deep underground and demonstrating the value of enlisting the enthusiasm of curious nonexperts for science. (The earthquake’s death toll was about 2,200 people, much lower than the one in 2010, largely because the epicenter was in a more rural part of the country.)', '“In 2021, we had that information in real time,” said Eric Calais, a geophysicist at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris who has studied the tectonics of the Caribbean for more than 30 years. “So that’s a big difference.”', 'Writing in an article published on Thursday in the journal Science, Dr. Calais and his colleagues described what the citizen science seismometers revealed about the August earthquake. About 40 miles of the same fault that caused the devastating 2010 earthquake ruptured, but farther to the west. The data also revealed some surprises, Dr. Calais said: At the eastern end of this segment, the fault was not vertical, where two tectonic plates are sliding past each other. Instead, the two plates were also being pushed together, with the northern one sliding on top of the southern one.', '“If we hadn’t had the aftershock distribution, then we would not have been able to put in our models the proper full geometry,” Dr. Calais said. “Then our assessment of what went on would have been wrong.”', 'The Caribbean is sometimes a zone of overlooked seismic dangers with active volcanoes and earthquake faults. “The Caribbean is its own small-scale Ring of Fire,” said Susan E. Hough, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. “It’s like the Pacific Rim on a smaller scale.”', 'But the tectonic plates are crashing together at a slower pace, and major earthquakes occur less often. The second half of the 20th century was pretty quiet in the region. “People got kind of complacent about it,” Dr. Hough said. “The 2010 earthquake didn’t surprise any earthquake professionals in the world, but it surprised a lot of people that weren’t aware of the scientific results.”', 'Dr. Hough and Dr. Calais were two of the earthquake experts who traveled to Haiti in 2010. In the aftermath of the quake that year, international organizations provided financing to set up conventional seismometers, which cost tens of thousands of dollars each, in Haiti. When the magnitude-7.2 earthquake hit on Aug. 14, none of Haiti’s conventional seismometers were working, although a seismometer at the United States embassy was gathering data.', '“It turns out to just be difficult, if not impossible, to run a conventional kind of state-of-the-art seismic network in Haiti,” Dr. Hough said. “They don’t have a functional power grid, for example, let alone reliable internet everywhere.”', 'Haiti remains politically unstable, suffers from widespread poverty and is vulnerable to natural disasters. The president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated the month before the August quake. A couple of days after the earthquake, a tropical storm, Grace, passed over the island.', 'In 2018, at a seismology conference in Malta, Dr. Calais met Branden Christensen, the chief executive of Raspberry Shake, a company based in Panama that combines a small, cheap computer called a Raspberry Pi with a small, cheap device used widely by the oil and natural gas industries to measure tiny ground motions, creating a seismometer that cost a few hundred dollars instead of tens of thousands of dollars.', 'The Raspberry Shake devices, smaller than a breadbox, can measure minute ground movements, although over a smaller range of frequencies than modern conventional seismometers can. But they do not need to be anchored to the ground and require only a power outlet and an internet connection.', '“I immediately thought that the level of simplicity of the device was such that it would have a better chance of survival in the long term in Haiti, meaning no maintenance,” Dr. Calais recalled. He used some leftover grant money to buy five of them, and, with colleagues in Haiti, he started looking for volunteers who would be willing to put one in their home or office. The network has since expanded to about 15 devices.', 'Dr. Calais said the Haiti data shows that while the Raspberry Shakes were not as capable as conventional seismometers, they nonetheless made scientifically valuable measurements. “They are able to do the job when it comes to recording even small aftershocks,” he said.', 'The Raspberry Shakes, however, are not immune to Haiti’s infrastructure limitations. Only one of the three near the epicenter was operational when the main earthquake struck last August.', 'The instrument closest to the epicenter was offline, because the host had let his internet service lapse. But he renewed it right after he felt the shaking. “We have to accept this kind of issue,” Dr. Calais said. “Internet and power are never a given in Haiti.”', 'The researchers were also able to add three Raspberry Shakes to the area, and all six measured more than a thousand aftershocks that followed in the weeks afterward.', 'The seismic data, published online, is only part of Dr. Calais’s motivation for setting up the Raspberry Shake network. It is also meant to spread knowledge about earthquake hazards among the volunteers hosting the Raspberry Shakes and other people in Haiti.', '“We want to push some people in the community to act differently,” said Steeve J. Symithe, a geophysicist at the State University of Haiti and an author of the Science paper.', 'Dr. Symithe, who was born in Haiti, was studying to become a civil engineer but switched fields after the 2010 earthquake, completing a doctorate at Purdue University with Dr. Calais, who was a professor there at the time.', 'Raspberry Shakes, which grew out of a Kickstarter project in 2016, are now installed around the world, with networks similar to Haiti’s in France, Oklahoma and Nepal. More than 1,600 devices report their data to the company’s website. “They’re popping up all over the place,” Mr. Christensen said.', 'With enough devices deployed, “you can start doing magical things in terms of, like, earthquake early warning,” Mr. Christensen said. “You can start mapping out and detecting earthquakes in places that people thought were aseismic or you can start mapping faults.”', 'Some of the research does not even involve earthquakes. In a paper published in Science in July 2020, scientists used data from 300 seismic stations, including 65 Raspberry Shakes, to observe a global quieting of noise from trains, planes, factories and other human-made sources as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.', '“Without Raspberry Shake, that would have been a very hard question to answer,” Mr. Christensen said. “The reason is that most seismographs that are professional grade are installed in the mountains and places that are really quiet, far away from humans.”']","['earthquake', 'Haiti', 'Calais', 'seismometer', 'Raspberry', 'datum', 'device', 'people', 'fault', 'network', 'internet', 'Hough', 'Christensen', 'aftershock', 'place', 'quake', 'shake', 'ground', 'Science', 'dollar']",images/57.png

But on Thursday, the company reported a big increase in the greenhouse gases emanating from its operations and its products, a reminder of the challenges that companies face as they try to clean up their businesses.', 'Microsoft’s carbon emissions were up 21.5 percent in the 12 months through June 2021, after small declines in 2020 and 2019. The increase was almost entirely driven by emissions from energy used to build data centers and make devices — like the Xbox and the Surface tablet — and from the power that Microsoft estimates its products consume when people used them.', 'Microsoft has sought to show that with committed leaders and sufficient funding, companies can effectively reduce their net emissions to zero in the coming years, bolstering international efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures. But the surge in Microsoft’s emissions suggests that it and other companies may have trouble meeting their goals. And since the increase resulted from strong demand for products, it is a reminder that robust business growth can often mean pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.', 'Still, Microsoft’s leaders say they can be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade, by cutting emissions and using a variety of measures to remove carbon from the atmosphere. “We’re still absolutely committed to — and absolutely sure of our ability to meet — our 2030 commitment,” said Lucas Joppa, Microsoft’s chief environmental officer.', 'Many large companies have some sort of plan to cut their emissions, and they face pressure from shareholders to do more. Investors have also pressed oil and gas companies to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy.', 'Microsoft is the first large tech company to report this year on the progress of its sustainability efforts. Apple, Google and Facebook’s parent, Meta, all aim to get their net carbon emissions to zero by 2030. Amazon, which has a large delivery network and much more extensive supply chains, has a 2040 goal to do the same.', '“None of this is going to be easy for any company — decarbonization is a challenge,” said Laura Draucker, a director at Ceres, a nonprofit group that works with investors and companies to address environmental challenges. But when large tech companies like Microsoft report setbacks on their emissions, she added, it should prompt them to press jointly for policies that promote “affordable, equitable access to clean energy.”', '“It doesn’t have any impact on their competitive advantage,” she added.', 'In a new move, Microsoft indicated on Thursday that it would no longer do specialized work for energy companies involved in extracting fossil fuels unless they had a “net zero” target. The term means having no carbon emissions overall, a goal companies typically hope to achieve through a combination of emissions reductions and carbon removal.', 'And Dr. Joppa said the recent disruptions in the oil and gas markets had not convinced him of the need to slow the move toward renewable sources of energy. “I would say that I have not seen anything that convinces me that we should do anything other than continue to go faster,” he said.', 'Microsoft is also active in pressing its climate agenda beyond its own business. When the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the public for input on how corporate climate change disclosures might be standardized, Microsoft said it would support the commission’s development of such disclosure rules.', 'Government moves to push companies to adopt climate policies could meet some resistance in Washington — especially since the spike in energy prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to calls to step up oil and gas production.', '“Private companies are free to pursue net-zero policies regardless of their sense — as long as they’re following the law, this isn’t a matter of public policy,” said Katie Tubb, senior policy analyst for energy and environment at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group, in an email. “Of greater concern are policymakers trying to use the force of government to pressure or even require such efforts in the private sector.”', 'In theory, Microsoft’s huge profits give it the means to achieve its goals. And the company has had success cutting emissions from its own operations and from the electricity that powers those operations, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in industry jargon. These fell 17 percent in the 12 months through June, and with greater purchases of clean power and efficiency measures, the company aims to get those emissions down to near zero by 2025, a goal that Dr. Joppa said Microsoft still expect to achieve.', 'Much harder is reducing Scope 3 emissions — those from a company’s supply chains and its customers. Microsoft’s Scope 3 emissions are nearly 50 times as large as Scopes 1 and 2 combined, and they rose 23 percent in the year through June, after small declines in previous years. The jump came from three main sources: energy used to build data centers; power consumed by suppliers; and energy expended when customers used Microsoft devices, which ballooned as the pandemic drove Xbox use.', 'Even so, Microsoft aims to more than halve its Scope 3 emissions by 2030. The company said on Thursday that it was working to reduce carbon emissions from construction and to make its devices more energy efficient.', 'And by removing millions of tons of carbon a year from the air, Microsoft hopes to reduce its total emissions to zero or lower on a net basis by the end of the decade.', 'One important factor will be the rapid development of carbon removal technologies, which are operating on a small scale and are expensive.

Instead the latest Walkman is a digital music player that costs $1,600 or $3,200.', 'This probably won’t be a big seller.

She didn’t start a boutique fitness craze; she’s not Jane Fonda. But Outdoor Voices, the athleisure company she founded in 2014, helped to popularize a fitness paradigm that has more to do with everyday movement than the body-stressing athleticism advertised by brands like Nike.', 'Outdoor Voices built a following with color-blocked compression leggings and all-in-one exercise dresses that could easily transition from gym to brunch. On social media, fans boasted about buying items in every shade and posted pictures of themselves #DoingThings in scenic locales while wearing matching sets. They also shared feedback on new styles and colorways in online forums. It was a customer-loyalty fairy tale.', 'Though she is no longer with Outdoor Voices, Ms. Haney, 33, is hoping to bring its tenets of community building and consumer engagement into a new sphere: the blockchain-based future of the internet known as web3. She’s betting that in the next phase of online retail, “minting things” will be the new “doing things.”', 'Her latest venture, a platform called Try Your Best, will enable brands to collect input from customers in exchange for rewards such as digital collectibles (NFTs) and brand coins that can be used for bragging rights or toward purchases. These are assets, Ms. Haney said, that could potentially have lasting value, as opposed to the one-time discount codes and fleeting perks most companies offer loyalists.', '“The idea is that brands and fans build together, and the concept is to share value with those who create it,” Ms. Haney said in an interview.', 'Direct-to-consumer brands have typically relied on disparate sources to solicit feedback from their most engaged customers: Google Docs, Slack bases, DMs. Try Your Best aims to streamline that process, and to route marketing dollars away from Facebook and Instagram, where Ms. Haney said that soaring costs have made it harder for emerging brands to grow.', 'So far, 10 brands have signed up for Try Your Best’s pilot program, the company said, including Hill House Home, whose “nap dresses” became the height of pandemic loungewear, and Vada, a jewelry and eyewear company. But at the start, the only brand on the platform will be Joggy, a new brand led by Ms. Haney that sells products containing CBD and THCV.', 'She said that Try Your Best hopes to reach “the Parade customer, the JuneShine customer, the Glossier customer — these millennial, Gen Z-type audiences.”', 'The target users are “the people who buy a brand because they love it and post about it on Instagram,” said Sean Judge, a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, which specializes in blockchain-related investments and put $2 million into Try Your Best — a modest figure compared with Outdoor Voices’ fund-raising. “This is a way for them to connect with others in that community and also have a direct relationship with brands to provide real-time feedback around new product ideas and where the brand should head.”', 'Ms. Haney said that involving consumers in design decisions helped drive the success behind some of Outdoor Voices’s most popular products. “The way that we got people to buy every color — 25 colors — of the exercise dress was by bringing them upstream in the product creation process,” she said, but “there was really no centralized tool for this type of interaction.”', 'Casey Lewis, a trend researcher who writes about youth culture in her Substack newsletter, After School, was intrigued by the idea of brands rethinking customer loyalty but circumspect about the appeal of digital assets.', '“Any time a brand can successfully build a community, it’s a huge win for them. But it’s so, so hard to manufacture or force that success,” Ms. Lewis said. “The biggest question is: Do people care about NFTs, and will that be enough to get them involved and excited?”', 'Web3 has been billed, often in vague and utopian terms, as an online ecosystem where users will wrest power from the tech behemoths that dominate the current phase of the internet, Web 2.0.', 'Kevin Werbach, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the author of “The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust,” said that while “granting strong ownership rights directly to users” could potentially shift the balance of power, none of web3’s promises are guaranteed.', '“There’s a web3 that’s out there which is wonderful and trying to make the world a better place, but just by labeling something web3, it doesn’t mean power dynamics will magically reverse,” Professor Werbach said.', 'Ms. Haney is especially interested in bringing women into web3. “We’re seeing a predominantly male demo on Reddit and in Discords, telling each other about all of these opportunities,” she said. “By bringing brands that do have a large female audience base into crypto, that’s a really big opportunity.”', 'Try Your Best runs on the Avalanche blockchain, which Ms. Haney said she chose in part because its transactions use significantly less energy than, say, Bitcoin or Ethereum. (Even supposedly “green” mining operations, however, are much more energy intensive than other financial transactions.)', 'Try Your Best plans to make money by collecting a monthly fee from brands and potentially sharing in revenue when tokens were used to drive sales.', 'Mr. Judge, the investor, previously worked with a range of direct-to-consumer companies, and heard constant frustration from them about the escalating costs of advertising to customers on Facebook and Instagram. Ms. Haney “experienced these pain points firsthand,” he said.', 'Outdoor Voices was a huge success. Ms. Haney and the company were the subject of a glowing feature in The New Yorker that compared Outdoor Voices to Lululemon, and it raised more than $50 million in venture capital. It also attracted the attention of Mickey Drexler, the retail legend who led transformations at Gap and J. Crew. He became chairman of the board and drew investors to the brand.', 'A glossary. Cryptocurrencies\xa0have gone from a curiosity to a viable investment, making them almost impossible to ignore. If you are struggling with the terminology, let us help:', 'Bitcoin. A Bitcoin\xa0is a digital token that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which this form of digital currency is stored and moved.', 'Blockchain. A blockchain\xa0is a database maintained communally, that reliably stores digital information. The original blockchain was the database on which all Bitcoin transactions were stored, but non-currency-based companies and governments are also trying to use blockchain technology to store their data.', 'Cryptocurrencies. Since Bitcoin was first conceived in 2008, thousands of\xa0other virtual currencies, known as cryptocurrencies, have been developed. Among them are Ether, Dogecoin\xa0and Tether.', 'Coinbase. The first major cryptocurrency company to list its shares on a U.S. stock exchange, Coinbase is a platform that allows people and companies to buy and sell various digital currencies, including Bitcoin, for a transaction fee.', 'Crypto finance. The development of cryptocurrencies spawned a parallel universe of alternative financial services,\xa0known as Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, allowing crypto businesses to move into traditional banking territory, including lending and borrowing.', 'NFTs. A “nonfungible token,” or NFT, is an asset verified using blockchain technology, in which a network of computers records transactions and gives buyers proof of authenticity and ownership. NFTs make digital artworks\xa0unique, and therefore sellable.', 'But just before the pandemic hit the United States, Ms. Haney’s successful run at Outdoor Voices came to a screeching halt as investors questioned her leadership. A schism had opened between the young founder and Mr. Drexler, costly store openings were delayed, and a string of experienced retail executives left the company, which struggled with a relocation to Austin, Texas, from New York. The internal troubles were detailed in articles in The New York Times and BuzzFeed News.', 'Ms. Haney recalled thinking at the time, “My life is going to be over.”', 'But as the news cycle moved on, so did she. “It sucked but it didn’t kill me, and it gave me that much more energy to go build again and show I can set vision and execute against it,” she said. “It feels good to take full accountability.”', 'Ms. Haney resigned from the brand in the investor tumult in February 2020 and then rejoined two months later with the title founder. In January 2021, she left the company and the board to pursue projects including Try Your Best. She still retains a stake in Outdoor Voices.', 'Mr. Judge was not concerned with Ms. Haney’s tussle with investors at Outdoor Voices, and viewed it as a vote of confidence that several former employees of the firm have since joined her at Try Your Best.', '“There’s challenges with every type of business, and some are more public than others,” Mr. Judge said. “I think Ty learned an incredible amount about building a business.”', 'Ms. Haney said that her start-up is arriving at a time when the traditional direct-to-consumer model — which has built businesses like Warby Parker, Everlane and Glossier — is “broken” after years of overreliance on social marketing.', 'At one point, she said, Outdoor Voices was devoting about 30 percent of its total funding to acquiring customers on Facebook and Instagram. She’s hoping Try Your Best can help brands lower those costs.', 'Separately, as younger people may be less willing to hand over their thoughts and time for free, Try Your Best offers an answer to the question of how to pay them back.', '“One thing with Gen Z is they want to be rewarded for their input and advice,” Ms. Lewis said. “This is not a generation who is willing to do things just for the heck of it.”']","['brand', 'Haney', 'company', 'customer', 'Outdoor', 'Voices', 'time', 'people', 'consumer', 'blockchain', 'investor', 'transaction', 'web3', 'product', 'user', 'business', 'New', 'currency', 'Instagram', 'thing']",images/60.png

Pigs are expressive animals with a wide range of vocalizations, according to Stewart Skinner, 38, a co-owner of the farm. Interpreting their calls can occasionally stump even experienced farmers.', '“I have often joked that this job would be far easier if we could speak pig,” Mr. Skinner said.', 'Decoding the emotions behind those oinks could soon become a little easier. Researchers in Europe have created an algorithm that assesses pigs’ emotional states based on the sound the animals make.', '“Animal welfare is nowadays widely accepted to be based not only on the physical health of animals, but also their mental health,” said Elodie Briefer, an associate professor of biology at the University of Copenhagen and an author of the study published this week in the journal Scientific Reports. The sooner a farmer can discern whether an animal is pleased or distressed, the faster any issues in the animal’s environment that may affect its health can be addressed.', 'Pigs are among the more voluble of domestic animals, producing a wider range of sounds more frequently than relatively taciturn goats, sheep and cows. To crack the code of pig communication, scientists in five research labs across Europe used hand-held microphones to gather roughly 7,400 distinct calls from 411 individual pigs. The calls were recorded during all types of situations in the life span of a pig, from birth to the slaughterhouse.', 'Researchers then assigned each sound a positive or negative emotional value based on what the paper calls “intuitive inference.” In other words, researchers made an educated guess about how the pig likely felt about the event at which the sound was recorded (i.e. feeding, good; castration, bad).', 'Upon first listen, most people tend to do slightly better than chance at guessing a pig’s feelings based on its sound alone. Listen closely to enough pig calls, though, and patterns emerge.', 'Grunts associated with positive emotions — the sounds pigs make when feeding, running or reuniting with their mothers or littermates after a separation — tend to be shorter, and have a one-note consistency in tone.', 'Unsurprisingly, an unhappy pig sounds awful. Situations that produced cries of distress included being inadvertently crushed by a mother sow (a common peril for piglets), awaiting slaughter, hunger, fights and the unwelcome surprise of strange people or objects in their pens. The screams, squeals and barks recorded from animals experiencing fear or pain are both longer in duration and more variable in tone than the sounds of contentment.', 'When taught to listen for these simple distinctions, humans do a better job of accurately interpreting an animal’s emotional state, Dr. Briefer said. But artificial intelligence performed best of all. The researchers’ algorithm, designed by co-author Ciara Sypherd, correctly identified the animal’s emotion as positive or negative 92 percent of the time.', 'The study is the product of SoundWel, a project sponsored by the European Union to improve animal health and welfare. Researchers with the project are now looking to partner with an engineer who can incorporate their data into an app or other tool that farmers could use to interpret their animals’ calls, and emotional state, in real time, Dr. Briefer said.', 'Understanding animals’ emotions has practical and legal consequences. Animal sentience laws like the one currently before Britain’s parliament assert that animals are capable of thought and feeling, and that the government must take their welfare into account when making policies that might affect them. The European Union recognized animal sentience in 2009.', 'A cost-effective and user-friendly tool for decoding pig grunts could be a valuable asset on a farm, Mr. Skinner said.', '“The ability to recognize problems early is the largest determining factor in success of treatment,” Mr. Skinner said. “Any tool that is adaptable to barn settings that would increase the understanding of what the individual animals are feeling would have value.”']","['animal', 'pig', 'sound', 'researcher', 'call', 'farm', 'health', 'emotion', 'Skinner', 'Briefer', 'state', 'farmer', 'tool', 'grunt', 'feeling', 'welfare', 'job', 'time', 'Union', 'situation']",images/70.png

Few knew they were in a relationship.', '“She was the Wizard of Oz, dazzling the investors and media, but he was the one behind the curtain working the machinery,” said Reed Kathrein, a San Francisco lawyer who successfully sued Ms. Holmes and Theranos in 2016 on behalf of investors. He said he was confident the prosecution would show that “he knew she was lying and never put a stop to it.”', '“He knew everything,” Mr. Kathrein said.', 'Mr. Balwani’s trial will go over familiar ground. He faces the same 12 charges that Ms. Holmes initially confronted. (One count was dropped after a procedural error by the government.)

He got a divorce, went back to school to get an M.B.A. and study computer science, and bought fancy cars. (His license plate, in a nod to Karl Marx, was DASKPTL.) When he joined Theranos, he invested millions of his own money in it, his lawyers have said.', 'At Theranos, he had a reputation for being a harsh, demanding boss who became increasingly paranoid that employees would steal trade secrets that would supposedly revolutionize blood testing.

He denied the accusations, and text messages released during the trial depicted a relationship of more or less equals, especially as the company came under pressure from whistle-blowers and the media.', '“The whole thing that we have to respond to liars is ridiculous,” Ms. Holmes fumed in one message.

He wasn’t originally supposed to do it — Ms. Holmes had to cancel — and did not look like he was enjoying himself.', 'Mr. Balwani told the legislators that the company was working on “something that we believe is magical.” He talked about one particular patient, who “had no limbs.” When this man had to give blood, the needle went into his neck. At the Theranos clinic, however, “he had a small limb attached to his body” and “we were able to do a finger prick on him.”', 'How a limbless individual suddenly gained a limb was not explained.

Both 52, they have become stars on the international art circuit, and represented their native South Korea at the 2015 Venice Biennale.', 'Their latest show alights at the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa, Japan, in May, and it encompasses video installations as well as an ongoing urban regeneration project in the nearby seaside village of Kanaiwa. That project includes the redesign, with the architect Yuji Nakae, of a dilapidated wall that shields the area from wind, sand and marine debris. A new video will follow a man searching for survivors on a lifeboat in a post-apocalyptic, virtual reality world.', 'Such futuristic, post-disaster settings have become a recurring interest for the pair, a means for addressing contemporary issues from oblique angles. “Moon and I don’t like to give some message to the audience,” said Mr. Jeon. “We want to give a key —”', '“— or a clue of our ideas,” said Ms. Moon, finishing his sentence, as they often do for each other.', 'William Morris’s 1890 novel, “News From Nowhere,” has served as an inspiration and a title for their work.

Civilization has crashed; humans are trying to move forward.', 'The centerpiece of their recent show at the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) here was a two-screen video born of their research on Taesung Freedom Village, which is in the Demilitarized Zone and guarded by the United Nations Command. Its roughly 200 residents receive special tax breaks but are subject to a curfew and closely monitored. (The pair were not able to get permission to shoot there.)', 'On one screen, a local man wanders through a forest, catalogs plants and sends samples aloft via balloon. Mysteriously, its contents appear on the second screen in a hermetically sealed high-tech chamber inhabited by a lone man. He is under video surveillance and fed by pouches that his computerized home delivers. He examines the specimens, secretly plants a seed and decides to don a mask and venture outside.', 'The piece, planned before the pandemic, has taken on new resonance. “The Freedom Village, itself, presents us now,” said the MMCA curator Joowon Park, who organized the show. “We are entirely isolated — physically, because we are wearing a mask every day, but also mentally.”', 'Decades-old photos of Taesung that the artists subtly altered, shielding people’s identities, hung near the videos, and Ms. Park said that many young people who visited were “confused about whether this village is real or not.” Its 70-year estrangement is a result of the Korean War, but “these kinds of stories are everywhere in the world,” she said, drawing analogies to Kabul, Hong Kong and Taiwan, all places with fraught borders or constrained movement.', 'The Freedom Village video will be in Kanazawa with the duo’s first film, “El Fin del Mundo (2012),” which also uses a dual structure that spans time. On one screen, a man in a rundown studio is at work on a ramshackle sculpture; in the other, a woman in a viciously commercialized future visits the room, studies his materials — now artifacts — and becomes entranced.', 'It is a “philosophical-social Korean reflection on the future — or the present in the future as a past,” said Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, the director of the Castello di Rivoli art museum in Turin, Italy, who invited them to participate in her 2012 edition of the important Documenta exhibition in Kassel, Germany.', 'One might take the piece as an allegory for their enduring faith in making experimental art. Mr. Jeon said they aim to ask, “What is the meaning of contemporary art?” They demonstrate that it can be a forum for uniting disparate creative forces.', 'In a 2013 Chicago show by Ms. Moon and Mr. Jeon, the Dutch architecture firm MVRDV offered renderings of inhabitable, biodegradable “bubbles,” responding to a dystopic scenario from the artists.

Boynton, principal deputy assistant attorney general, said in a statement.', 'WW agreed to pay a $1.5 million penalty as part of a settlement, and to erase the algorithms it had derived from the user data, the F.T.C. said.', 'Weight Watchers purchased Kurbo, a technology start-up, in 2018, the year it rebranded itself as WW, and introduced Kurbo by WW the next year, billing it as a way of promoting healthy eating habits among children. Users enter their height, weight, age and health goals, and then track what they eat and how much they exercise.', 'The app drew criticism from pediatricians, nutritionists and others who warned that weight-loss programs for children can lead to eating disorders and low self-esteem. Nearly 115,000 people signed a Change.org petition asking WW to remove Kurbo.', 'According to the F.T.C., through late 2019, users could sign up for Kurbo either on the app or the WW website by indicating they were a parent registering a child under 13, or a child who was over 13.', 'By giving users those choices, the complaint said, the company “signaled to children that they could register without involving a parent by indicating they were at least 13 years old.” The sign-up process was revised in 2020, the commission said.', 'In addition to tracking food intake, weight and activity levels, the app also collected user data, including names, birth dates and email addresses, the F.T.C. said.', 'In a statement, Kurbo’s general counsel, Michael Colosi, said the information the company gathered was used only to help users improve their eating habits. The company did not violate COPPA, he said, adding that the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing.', '“The limited information received in the free app experience was designed to be collected in an anonymous environment and used solely for the purpose of helping the users develop better eating habits,” he said. “At no time did Kurbo ever target children with advertising, sell data to third parties or otherwise monetize its users in any way.”', 'Ben Winters, a lawyer at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said the F.T.C. appeared to be applying a version of a legal doctrine known as “the fruit of the poisonous tree,” in which evidence is deemed inadmissible if it was obtained illegally. He said the commission had previously applied the doctrine when it fined Facebook about $5 billion for allowing Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm, to harvest personal information from its users.', '“It’s a privacy case that was enforced using the only real privacy law we have — and it’s only for kids,” Mr. Winters said, referring to COPPA. “It’s interesting for the F.T.C. to use the poison-tree remedy in a more run-of-the-mill case, and that’s something we really want to be seeing.”', 'The American Association of Pediatrics released a report in 2016 discouraging parents and families from discussing weight and weight loss with their children, warning that such conversations could increase the likelihood that children will develop an eating disorder. The report encouraged families to instead emphasize healthy eating habits and an active lifestyle.', 'Kurbo’s website features testimonials from users as young as 10 who say they used the site’s “traffic light food system” to lose weight. Healthy foods such as skim milk, fruits and vegetables are given the “green light,” while “red light” foods — such as cookies and cake, but also whole milk and peanut butter — are discouraged. Children who meet their weekly diet and exercise goals are rewarded in the Kurbo app.', '“Food is food, and it is frightening to think about providing children with messages that suggests otherwise,” said Anna Sweeney, a dietitian who specializes in eating disorders. “Children grow up to be adults who then have the misfortune of having to heal their relationship with food that was damaged when they were very, very young.”']","['child', 'user', 'Kurbo', 'weight', 'food', 'app', 'information', 'parent', 'datum', 'loss', 'company', 'habit', 'year', 'commission', 'WW', 'disorder', 'Winters', 'settlement', 'statement', 'doctrine']",images/75.png

Jason Russell, a founder of the nonprofit Invisible Children, had directed a film called “Kony 2012” that was meant to expose a violent crisis.', '“We felt if people in the Western world knew about this atrocity, it’d stop in days,” Mr. Russell, 43, said in a phone interview.', 'In the video, released on YouTube by Invisible Children, Mr. Russell explains the conflict in simple terms suited for his 5-year-old son, Gavin, who appears in the video alongside inspirational images of defiant Ugandan children and activists in North America. At the end, Mr. Russell issues a call to action: for celebrities, policymakers and anyone else watching to help make Joseph Kony a household name.', 'When Oprah Winfrey tweeted “Kony 2012,” its views rose from 66,000 to nine million, according to Gilad Lotan, a data scientist who compiled a visual analysis of its spread. Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Kim Kardashian shared it, too. Within a week, the video had hit 100 million — a record on YouTube at the time — and Mr. Kony had become the target of a global civilian manhunt.', 'Ten years on, Mr. Kony remains at large, Gavin has started high school, and Mr. Russell is still grappling with the mixed legacy of “Kony 2012.” At a time when a constant stream of videos on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter is illustrating the real-time destruction of Ukrainian cities by Russian forces, the film reads as both a relic of what experts have described as a techno-optimistic post-Arab Spring digital landscape and a precursor to an era of seemingly endless footage of violence and conflict on social media.', 'Invisible Children, which was founded in 2004 by Mr. Russell, Bobby Bailey and Laren Poole, had screened films about Mr. Kony and his rebel group, the Lord’s Resistance Army, at events around the country, reaching a total of five million viewers, according to Mr. Russell. “Kony 2012,” he said, was “the first time we aggressively went after social media.”', 'In his analysis of the video’s spread, Mr. Lotan, the data scientist, noted dense clusters of activity in Dayton, Ohio, and Birmingham, Ala., two cities where Invisible Children had stopped on tour.', 'The spread of the film on the internet opened the organization up to all kinds of critiques. People online debated the film’s racial politics, the ethics of humanitarianism and the utility of “slacktivism,” the equation of likes and shares with action.', '“The top criticism that I have read about over the years is the oversimplification of a complex issue,” Mr. Russell said. “To that I would say, ‘I hear you, but to make something go viral’ — our goal was to simplify a complex issue — ‘that’s what you have to do.’ In a sense it’s meant as a criticism, but I saw it as a compliment.”', 'At the time, the attention the film received became overwhelming for Mr. Russell, who was filmed walking naked around his neighborhood, yelling obscenities just over a week after its release. “There are very few examples of people who have been publicly shamed and put under that white-hot light that don’t have some kind of breakdown,” he said.', 'The footage was sold to TMZ, according to Mr. Russell, and #Horny2012 overtook #Kony2012 in trending hashtags on Twitter, as inaccurate reports surfaced that he had been masturbating in public. What began as an earnest attempt at consciousness raising had become a meme.', 'But the film clearly struck a chord with viewers, tapping into what Jonah Berger, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the author of “Contagious: Why Things Catch On,” refers to as STEPPS: social currency, triggers, emotion, public practical value and story. These factors appeal to our psychological makeup and basic human motivations, Professor Berger said.', 'Eric Meyerson, the former head of partner marketing at YouTube, said that, at the time, “Kony 2012” leaned on the emotional qualities of the internet’s most resonant videos. Its first three minutes include footage of the Arab Spring and a child riding his bike for the first time.', '“They were the videos that we at YouTube were trying to promote at the time, to submit for Webbys, the kinds of videos that would inspire good feelings, which are what bring people back to a platform,” Mr. Meyerson said. He added that in some cases viewers were left with the feeling that by consuming and sharing content, “they were helping to change the world.”', 'When Mr. Meyerson joined Facebook in 2015 to lead its video marketing team, that earnest sense of possibility still stood. But after the introduction of Facebook Live in August, the mood shifted, as graphic live-streamed footage started to appear.', '“Then we had the rise of fake news, Brexit, Trump’s election,” he said, “and all of a sudden, by the end of 2016, it went from ‘social media can change the world for the better’ to ‘Facebook and YouTube and Twitter are destroying democracy.’” The conversations that soon followed were focused on algorithms, echo chambers and “post-truth” politics.', '“The early 2010s was incredibly pivotal in changing our current information environment, and it doesn’t get the attention it deserves,” Mr. Meyerson said.', 'Now, the earliest images of conflict and crisis often come to us through social media, and are informed by the platforms where they are shared. “The advent of digital war has challenged the mainstream media and other elite actors in their capacity to shape what war looks like,” said Andrew Hoskins, an interdisciplinary research professor at the University of Glasgow.', '“Looking at Twitter right now is very interesting,” he said, referring to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has been called the first TikTok war. The immense amount of “footage that floods our consciousness of conflict,” he said — open-source intelligence, citizen journalism on TikTok — “might revolutionize war, but it might make no difference at all.”', 'In 2017, the United States and Uganda scaled back a mission to capture Mr. Kony, stating that he no longer represented a regional threat. “Atrocities committed by the L.R.A. have been reduced by 80 percent,” Samuel Enosa Peni, the archbishop of the Western Equatoria State, wrote in an email. (He has lost three siblings to the army.)', 'Today, Invisible Children is focused entirely on local programs in Central Africa.

Black is definitely not the only option.', 'More options are great, but they can also be overwhelming. I bet some new car buyers have a hard time picking among those Ford trucks.

Help Casinos Cut Down on Problem Gambling?,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/technology/ai-casinos-gambling-problems.html,"['This article is part of a new series on artificial intelligence’s potential to solve everyday problems.', 'A few years ago, Alan Feldman wandered onto the exhibition floor at ICE London, a major event in the gaming industry.', 'Mr. Feldman had spent the past 30 years as an executive with MGM Resorts International, focusing on problem gambling and the financial, personal and professional repercussions. Before his departure from the company, he helped build a nationwide responsible-gambling program that focused on helping players shift their behaviors to reduce the risk of becoming problem gamblers.', 'While on the floor at ICE, he noticed a few companies promoting new products that would use artificial intelligence to not only identify problem gambling, but predict it. Mr. Feldman was immediately skeptical. A.I., he thought, might do a lot of things, but he had never heard of a use that predicted a state of mind.', 'A.I. as a solution to problem gambling “raised far more questions than it did answers,” said Mr. Feldman, now a distinguished fellow in responsible gambling at the International Gaming Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “It was slick, it was interesting, it was compelling intellectually. But whether or not it was really going to do anything, I thought, very much remained at question.”', 'Another question, this one obvious to any observer: Isn’t a problem gambler exactly what a casino wants financially? In short, Mr. Feldman said: no. Even putting aside regulatory issues — gambling operators can be fined or lose their licenses if they fail to monitor problem gambling and act when necessary — it is, counterintuitively, not in their best financial interest.', '“Casinos need to have customers in order to sustain themselves,” Mr. Feldman said. “And the only way to have customers is to have customers who themselves are healthy and thriving and able to pay their bills and come back the next time.” Problem gamblers “always end the same way,” he added. “The end of the road is the exact same with all of them: They have no money.”', 'Not everyone agrees. Academics who study responsible gambling say those programs are charged with helping people individually without affecting operations on an overall scale.', '“Some operators have more robust responsible gambling programs than others,” says Lia Nower, director of the Center for Gambling Studies at Rutgers University. “But in the end there is a profit motive and I have yet to see an operator in the U.S. put the same amount of money and effort into developing a system for identifying and assisting at-risk players as they do developing A.I. technologies for marketing or extending credit to encourage players to return.”', 'In either case, the pairing of A.I. and gambling makes perfect sense: unlimited and constant data; decision-making; computerized systems. With the explosion of online gaming, the opportunities to harness this combination for a public good seem endless. The reality — interpreting human behavior, navigating privacy laws, addressing regulatory issues — is much more complicated.', 'At the same time that Mr. Feldman was questioning those potential solutions, Danish researchers were trying to solve the same problems. Mindway AI, a company that grew out of Aarhus University, does exactly what Mr. Feldman was skeptical of: It predicts future problem gambling. Built using research at Aarhus University by its founder, Kim Mouridsen, the company uses psychologists to train A.I. algorithms in identifying behaviors associated with problem gambling.', 'One significant challenge is that there is no sole indicator of whether someone is a problem gambler, said Rasmus Kjærgaard, Mindway’s chief executive. And at most casinos, human detection of problem gambling focuses on just a few factors — mostly money spent and time played. Mindway’s system takes into account 14 different risks. Those include money and time but also canceled bank withdrawals, shifts in the time of day the player is playing and erratic changes of wagers. Each factor is given a score from 1 to 100, and the A.I. then builds out a risk assessment of each player, improving itself with each hand of poker or spin of the roulette wheel. Players are scored from green (you’re doing fine) to blood red (immediately step away from the game).', 'In order to tailor the algorithm to a new casino or online operator, Mindway hands over its data to a group of experts and psychologists trained in identifying such behavior. (The company said they were independent, paid consultants.) They assess each client’s customers and use that model as a sort of baseline. The algorithm then replicates its diagnosis to the full customer database.', '“As soon as a player profile or player behavior goes from green to yellow and to the other steps as well, we are able to do something about it,” Mr. Kjærgaard said. The value in the program isn’t necessarily just identifying those blood-red problem gamblers; by monitoring the jumps along Mindway’s color spectrum, it predicts and catches players as their play devolves. Currently, he said, casinos and online operators focus their attention on the blood-red gamblers; with Mindway they can identify the players before they ever reach that point.', 'The trickiest step, though, according to Brett Abarbanel, director of research at U.N.L.V.’s International Gaming Institute, is taking that data and explaining it to a player.', '“If my algorithm flags someone, and it thinks that they’re a problem gambler, I’m not going to send them a note and say, ‘Hey, great news, my algorithm has identified you as potentially a problem gambler. You should stop gambling right away!’” The response would be obvious, Dr. Abarbanel said, deploying a middle finger: “That’s what will happen.”', 'How to actually communicate that information — and what to tell the gambler — is an ongoing debate. Some online-gaming companies use pop-up messaging; others use texts or emails. Mr. Kjærgaard hopes that clients take his data and, depending on the level of risk, reach out to the player directly by phone; the specificity of the data, he said, helps personalize such calls.', 'Since starting in 2018, Mindway has contracted its services to seven Danish operators, two each in Germany and the Netherlands, one global operator and a U.S. sports-gambling operator, Mr. Kjærgaard said. The online gambling giants Flutter Entertainment and Entain have both partnered with Mindway as well, according to the companies’ annual reports.', 'Since this technology is so new and there’s no regulatory body setting a standard, Mindway and similar companies are, for now, essentially on their own. “We wanted to be able to say to you, to anybody else — operators, obviously — that not only do we provide this scientific-based software, but we also want to have a third party to test the validation of what we do,” Mr. Kjærgaard said. “But it is a paradox that there’s no specific requirements which I can ask my team to fulfill.”', 'Currently, Mindway’s technology lives mostly in online gambling. Operators attach Mindway’s GameScanner system to their portal, and it analyzes not only individual risks, but total risks for the system. Applying that level of oversight to in-person gambling is much more difficult.', 'One example of a measure of success can be found in Macau. Casino operators there use hidden cameras and facial-recognition technology to track gamblers’ betting behavior, as well as poker chips enabled with radio-frequency-identification technology and sensors on baccarat tables. This data then heads to a central database where a player’s performance is tracked and monitored for interplayer collusion.', 'This, Mr. Kjærgaard said, is the future: The financial incentives will drive success. “Smart tables” and efforts to address money laundering and financial regulations may eventually provide the data that will supercharge the application of A.I. to in-person gambling.', '(It also highlights another difficulty in applying A.I. to gambling: cultural differences. In Chinese casinos, Dr. Abarbanel said, the players are used to this level of monitoring; not so in the United States.)', 'A.I. would certainly work for casinos when it came to marketing, promotions and game-suggestion, Mr. Feldman said, but despite progress in recent years, he remains skeptical of its use to help problem gamblers. The application of such a tool may be better used personally instead of broadly, he believes, much like the “Your spending is 25 percent higher than last month” reminders that pop up in online banking accounts.', '“It’s sort of like drinking. Is there anyone you know who hasn’t gotten drunk once in their life? Doesn’t mean they’re an alcoholic,” he said. “But maybe that one drink a night that’s kind of become one and a half, sometimes two, sometimes three — maybe you want to bring that in a little bit. But you don’t want to have the bar tracking every record here, right?”']","['gambling', 'problem', 'player', 'gambler', 'operator', 'Mindway', 'A.I.', 'Feldman', 'company', 'casino', 'risk', 'datum', 'Kjærgaard', 'behavior', 'time', 'money', 'technology', 'system', 'customer', 'University']",images/81.png

Putin tightened his grip on Russian society over the past 22 years, small pockets of independent information and political expression remained online.', 'Any remnants of that are now gone.', 'As Mr. Putin has waged war on Ukraine, a digital barricade went up between Russia and the world. Both Russian authorities and multinational internet companies built the wall with breathtaking speed. And the moves have ruptured an open internet that was once seen as helping to integrate Russia into the global community.', 'TikTok and Netflix are suspending their services in the country. Facebook has been blocked. Twitter has been partly blocked, and YouTube’s future is in doubt. Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco and others have pulled back or withdrawn entirely from Russia. Even online video games like Minecraft are no longer available.', 'The actions have turned Russia into a walled-off digital state akin to China and Iran, which tightly control the internet and censor foreign websites and dissent. China’s internet and the Western internet have become almost completely separate over the years, with few overlapping services and little direct communication. In Iran, the authorities have used internet blackouts during protests.', 'Russia’s cleaving off is a defeat for the once-held Western belief that the internet is a tool for democracy that would lead authoritarian countries to open.', '“The vision of a free and open internet that runs all over the world doesn’t really exist anymore,” said Brian Fishman, a senior fellow at the New America think tank and former director of counterterrorism policy at Facebook. “Now the internet is lumpy. It has choke points.”', 'The internet is only one piece of Russia’s growing isolation since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The country has been largely cut off from the world’s financial system, foreign airlines are not flying in Russian airspace and global access to its oil and natural gas reserves is in question.', 'But the digital cutoffs stand out as the culmination of attempts by the Russian authorities to tame what was once an open and freewheeling internet. For years, officials stiffened a censorship campaign at home and tried to move toward what is known as a “sovereign internet.” The war led multinational companies to take the final steps.', 'While Russia is paying a stiff economic cost for being cut off, the digital isolationism also serves Mr. Putin’s interests. It allows him to clamp down further on dissent and information that does not follow the government line. Under a censorship law passed last week, journalists, website operators and others risk 15 years in prison for publishing “misinformation” about the war on Ukraine.', '“This is going to feel like a return to the 1980s for people who lived in that era, because suddenly information is back in the hands of the state,” said Alp Toker, director of NetBlocks, a London organization that tracks internet censorship.', 'Internet censorship efforts in Russia have grown for the past decade, said Tanya Lokot, an associate professor at Dublin City University who specializes in digital rights in Eastern Europe. Mr. Putin first cracked down on government critics and independent news outlets online. Russia then began a campaign to install new censorship equipment to block or slow down access to websites like Twitter.', 'But the final break since the invasion began has jarred Russians who used the internet to stay connected with the wider world, get independent information and build their careers.', 'Aleksei Pivovarov, who quit his job on state television almost a decade ago in the face of growing censorship, said he had experienced a “second birth” when he started producing news shows and distributing them on YouTube. Almost three million people subscribe to his YouTube channel, where he and a team publish investigations and news reports that are unavailable on state media.', '“I was completely sure that this part of my life was over forever, and I would never work as a journalist again,” he said in a recent interview. “I never thought before I came to YouTube that it was possible.”', 'Now the work risks putting Mr. Pivovarov in jail — or out of business. YouTube, which is owned by Google, last week blocked all Russian accounts from making money from their videos and barred Russian state television outlets from being shown across Europe. YouTube could be one of the next targets to be blocked by Russian regulators, experts predicted.', 'Mr. Pivovarov, 47, who is based in Moscow, said he planned to keep broadcasting on YouTube despite the risks. But he said it was unclear how long he could keep going.', '“For the moment I do plan to work in Russia,” he said. “How this may change in the future, especially if YouTube will be blocked, I don’t know.”', 'Unlike China, where domestic internet companies have grown into behemoths over more than a decade, Russia does not have a similarly vibrant domestic internet or tech industry.', 'Russian forces appear stalled. With Russia’s advance on Ukraine’s major cities stalled and satellite imagery showing soldiers digging into defensive positions around Kyiv, a consensus is emerging in the West that the war has reached a bloody stalemate.', 'Mariupol is still suffering. Russian forces continued to bombard the besieged coastal city, hitting a\xa0drama school\xa0where 400 people were hiding, according to local officials. The city’s mayor said thousands of residents had been forcibly deported to Russia.', 'A Ukrainian base is hit. A missile attack on barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv killed more than 40 marines, a Ukrainian official said. That would make it one of the single deadliest attacks on Ukrainian forces since the start of the war, and the death toll could be much higher.', 'Putin does not want direct negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly called for direct negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the hope of ending the war, but Mr. Putin does not think the time is right for talks, according to a senior Turkish official.', 'So as it is cordoned off into its own digital ecosystem, the fallout may be severe. In addition to access to independent information, the future reliability of internet and telecommunications networks, as well as the availability of basic software and services used by businesses and government, is at risk.', 'Already, Russian telecom companies that operate mobile phone networks no longer have access to new equipment and services from companies like Nokia, Ericsson and Cisco. Efforts by Russian companies to develop new microprocessors were in doubt after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the largest maker of essential semiconductors, halted shipments to the country. Yandex, Russia’s largest internet company, with a search engine more widely used than Google in Russia, warned it might default on its debts because of the crisis.', '“The whole IT, hardware and software market that Russia relies on is gravely damaged right now,” said Aliaksandr Herasimenka, a researcher at the University of Oxford’s program on democracy and technology. The Russian authorities could respond by loosening rules that have made it illegal to download pirated software, he said.', 'The Ukrainian government has also pressured internet service providers to sever access in Russia. Officials from Ukraine have asked ICANN, the nonprofit group that oversees internet domains, to suspend the Russian internet domain “.ru.” The nonprofit has resisted these requests.', 'Denis Lyashkov, a self-taught web developer with more than 15 years of experience, said Russia’s censorship campaign was “devastating” for those who had grown up with a less restricted internet.', '“I was 19 years old when I bought my first computer, and it was the best investment in my life,” said Mr. Lyashkov, who emigrated to Armenia from Moscow in the past week because of the growing restrictions. “When I started, it was a whole new world. There were no borders, no censorship. Everyone could say anything they wanted.”', 'Mr. Lyashkov said that before he had fled Russia, the company where he worked received a demand from the government to install new government certificates on its website, a technical change that could allow regulators to monitor traffic and potentially close the country’s internet to all but Russian or other approved websites. Last year, Russia tested taking such a step.', 'Some Russian internet users appeared to be finding ways around tighter restrictions. Demand for virtual private networks, technology that lets people access blocked websites by masking their location, soared more than 600 percent since the invasion, according to Top10VPN, a service that tracks usage of the technology.', 'But other decisions by multinational companies to punish Russia’s aggression could make those circumvention tools harder to obtain. Many Russians who have VPNs pay for them using Visa and Mastercard, which have blocked payments in Russia.', '“That move only helps the Kremlin in my view, unfortunately,” Mr. Pivovarov said.', 'Kate Conger contributed reporting.']","['internet', 'Russia', 'company', 'YouTube', 'censorship', 'year', 'Putin', 'website', 'war', 'service', 'government', 'Ukraine', 'official', 'information', 'state', 'country', 'access', 'world', 'city', 'authority']",images/82.png

The footage and soundtrack were traced back to their original sources in a New York Times analysis of the videos.', 'TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app known for viral dance and lip-syncing videos, has emerged as one of the most popular platforms for sharing videos and photos of the Russia-Ukraine war. Over the past week, hundreds of thousands of videos about the conflict have been uploaded to the app from across the world, according to a review by The Times. The New Yorker has called the invasion the world’s “first TikTok war.”', 'The surge has put TikTok in a challenging position. For the first time, it is dealing with moderating a flood of videos — many of them unverified — about a single event that has captivated a global audience. That is leading it to essentially confront a large scale of misleading and distorted information that has long bedeviled more mature social networks and video sites, such as YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.', 'Many popular TikTok videos of the invasion — including of Ukrainians livestreaming from their bunkers — offer real accounts of the action, according to researchers who study the platform. But other videos have been impossible to authenticate and substantiate. Some simply appear to be exploiting the interest in the invasion for views, the researchers said.', 'In one example, Pravda, a Ukrainian newspaper, posted an audio clip featuring 13 Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island, an outpost of the Black Sea, facing a Russian military unit that asked them to surrender. The clip was then used in many TikTok videos, some of which included a note stating that all 13 soldiers had died. Ukrainian officials later said in a Facebook post that the men were alive and had been taken prisoner, but the TikTok videos have not been corrected.', '“There are people who are, right now, seeing war for the first time on TikTok,” said Abbie Richards, an independent researcher who studies the app. “People trust it. The result is that a lot of people are seeing false information about Ukraine and believing it.”', 'TikTok and other social media platforms are also under pressure from U.S. lawmakers and Ukrainian officials to curb Russian misinformation about the war, especially from state-backed media outlets such as Russia Today and Sputnik. In response, YouTube has said it would block Russia Today and Sputnik in the European Union, while Twitter and Meta, the parent of Facebook, have said they would label content from the outlets as state sponsored.', 'TikTok has also banned Sputnik and Russia Today in the E.U., and on Friday said it would start labeling the outlets as state-sponsored in the countries where they are still available. The app also said on Thursday that it had dedicated more resources to monitoring for misleading content about the war.', '“We continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation,” said Hilary McQuaide, a TikTok spokeswoman. On Sunday, TikTok said it would suspend livestreaming and new content being uploaded from Russia.', 'For years, TikTok largely escaped sustained scrutiny about its content. Unlike Facebook, which has been around since 2004, and YouTube, which was founded in 2005, TikTok only became widely used in the past five years. Owned by China’s ByteDance, the app was designed to make one- to three-minute videos easy to create and share. It developed a reputation as a destination for addictive, silly and fun videos, especially for young users.', 'The app has navigated some controversies in the past. It has faced questions over harmful fads that appeared to originate on its platform, as well as whether it allows underage users and adequately protects their privacy.', 'But the war in Ukraine has supersized the issues facing TikTok, which has over one billion users globally.', 'The volume of war content on the app far outweighs what is found on some other social networks, according to a review by The Times. Videos with the hashtag #Ukrainewar have amassed nearly 500 million views on TikTok, with some of the most popular videos gaining close to one million likes. In contrast, the #Ukrainewar hashtag on Instagram had 125,000 posts and the most popular videos were viewed tens of thousands of times.', 'The very features that TikTok designed to help people share and record their own content have also made it easy to spread unverified videos across its platform. That includes TikTok’s algorithm for its “For You” page, which suggests videos based on what people have previously seen, liked or shared. Viewing one video with misinformation likely leads to more videos with misinformation being shown, Ms. Richards said.', 'Another popular TikTok feature lets people easily reuse audio, which has enabled people to create lip-syncing scenes of popular movies or songs. But audio can be misused and taken out of context, Ms. Richards said.', 'Russian forces appear stalled. With Russia’s advance on Ukraine’s major cities stalled and satellite imagery showing soldiers digging into defensive positions around Kyiv, a consensus is emerging in the West that the war has reached a bloody stalemate.', 'Mariupol is still suffering.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly called for direct negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the hope of ending the war, but Mr. Putin does not think the time is right for talks, according to a senior Turkish official.', 'Over the last week, audio from a 2020 explosion in Beirut, Lebanon, was uploaded to several TikTok videos that claimed to show present-day Ukraine, according to The Times’s review. In another instance, a soundtrack of gunfire that was uploaded to TikTok on Feb. 1 — before Russia’s invasion — was later used in over 1,700 videos, many of which purported to be from the fighting in Ukraine, Ms. Richards said.', 'Removing such content is not easy, partly because of TikTok’s global nature. Once a video is uploaded, it is often recorded over and translated into dozens of languages. If the videos are not reported by users, they need to be independently found by content moderators proficient in those languages before they can be taken down.', '“Video is the hardest format to moderate for all platforms,” said Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and a former head of security at Facebook. “When combined with the fact that TikTok’s algorithm is the primary factor for what content a user sees, as opposed to friendships or follows on the big U.S. platforms, this makes TikTok a uniquely potent platform for viral propaganda.”', 'Dafne Atacan, 23, a Turkish national in the San Francisco Bay Area, said she was aware that she needed to fact check TikTok videos of the war. She said she had noticed that many of the videos appeared to be edited from news reports or were commentary from people in the United States who were watching Ukraine’s events from afar.', '“I feel like lately, the videos I’m seeing are designed to get me riled up, or to emotionally manipulate me,” she said. “I get worried so now, sometimes, I find myself Googling something or checking the comments to see if it is real before I trust it.”', 'Ms. Hernandez, the student in Los Angeles, said she was surprised to learn from a Times reporter that some TikTok videos she had viewed about the war were misleading and unreliable.', '“I guess I don’t really know what war looks like,” she said. “But we go to TikTok to learn about everything, so it makes sense we would trust it about this too.”', 'Ms. Hernandez added that TikTok remained her preferred platform for news.

Gov. Jay Inslee has not said whether he intends to sign the legislation.', 'Mike Faulk, a spokesman for Mr. Inslee, said Friday that the governor’s office usually did not “speculate on bill action,” adding, “Once legislators send it to our office, we’ll evaluate it.”', 'The Senate legislation — the result of a compromise between the companies and at least one prominent local union, the Teamsters — was approved 40 to 8.', 'In a statement, John Scearcy, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 117, said the union was “proud to stand in solidarity with Uber and Lyft drivers in winning their demands for pay raises” and other benefits.', 'Uber and Lyft have noted in regulatory filings that being required to classify drivers as employees would force changes to their business model and could leave them exposed financially. They have sought similar compromises in states including California and New York, but those efforts collapsed amid resistance from other unions and worker advocates, who argued that gig drivers should not have to settle for second-class status. Many of those advocates criticized the Washington bill as well.', '“While the bill provides some benefits to drivers, it would permanently lock the door on drivers accessing their rights as employees,” said Brian Chen of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group. “That is a misstep with serious ramifications, which is concerning given how fast this bill is moving through the legislature.”', 'Under the compromise, drivers would receive benefits like paid sick leave and a minimum pay rate. The bill would also create a process for drivers to appeal so-called deactivations, which prevent them from finding work through the companies’ apps.', 'While the minimum pay rates apply only to the time that drivers spend with a passenger in the car, supporters of the bill say the rates have been set high enough to compensate drivers fairly for all of their work time after expenses. The rates will be adjusted over time to account for cost of living increases.', 'As with other contractors, drivers must cover all payroll taxes and cannot unionize under federal law.', 'The bill is largely silent on unemployment benefits, something that employees are entitled to, but Washington State has frequently found that gig drivers should receive those benefits already. The bill will create a task force to study what the gig companies’ contributions to an unemployment insurance trust fund should be, an issue that has been contentious in other states.', 'One especially controversial feature of the bill is that it would block local jurisdictions from regulating drivers’ rights. A similar feature helped ignite opposition that killed the prospects for such a bill in New York State last year.', 'Seattle enacted a robust minimum wage law for gig drivers in 2020, which was intended to provide drivers with hourly pay of roughly $30 before expenses and was sharply criticized by gig companies. The statewide bill approved Friday preserved the current rates in Seattle, which will continue to be higher than the rest of the state, but would pre-empt similar legislation in the future.', 'Looming in the background of the legislative action in Washington State was the possibility of a ballot measure that could have locked in contractor status with weaker benefits for drivers. After California passed a law in 2019 that effectively classified gig workers as employees, Uber, Lyft and other gig companies spent roughly $200 million on a ballot measure, Proposition 22, that rolled back those protections. The legislation is still being litigated after a state judge deemed it unconstitutional.', 'Representative Liz Berry, who introduced the Washington State bill, said the differences between it and Proposition 22 “couldn’t be more stark.”', '“My focus has been: What do the workers want? What are the drivers asking for? And we deliver on every single thing they asked for,” Ms. Berry said in an interview, adding that in contrast to California’s law, “our bill has real benefits that employees in the state of Washington enjoy.”', 'Jen Hensley, Lyft’s head of government relations, said in a statement that the bill was “a solution that Washington State’s drivers overwhelmingly support. Not only does it deliver meaningful new benefits, it also expands important protections for them.” An Uber statement echoed those comments.', 'But some Washington legislators had doubts.', 'Ahead of the vote on Friday, Senator Mike Padden, who opposed the bill, worried about the speed of the approval process. “I do have some concerns about the bill itself, but I also have some concerns about not really being able to check it out properly,” he said.', 'Representative Debra Entenman, the only Democrat to vote against the bill in Washington’s House of Representatives, said in a statement after its Senate passage that “this bill requires too much from the state, delivers too little for drivers, and increases transportation costs for my constituents who often rely on rideshare companies because of inadequate public transportation options.”', 'Worker advocates worried that other states would try to replicate the legislation. “I hope Governor Inslee seeks additional analysis of its potential impact,” said Terri Gerstein, a workers rights lawyer at Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program. “I would urge other states not to use this bill or cursory public process as a model.”']","['bill', 'driver', 'benefit', 'state', 'gig', 'Washington', 'company', 'employee', 'State', 'legislation', 'worker', 'rate', 'statement', 'pay', 'law', 'compromise', 'time', 'Inslee', 'California', 'union']",images/87.png

There are going to be participants that are not under the strict control of any government.”', 'The online battles have blurred the lines between state-backed hackers and patriotic amateurs, making it difficult for governments to understand who is attacking them and how to retaliate.

But experts said that those efforts have attracted fewer participants. The hundreds of hackers now racing to support their respective governments represent a drastic and unpredictable expansion of cyberwarfare.', 'The involvement of the volunteer hackers makes it more difficult to determine who is responsible for an online attack. Some of the hackers said they were Ukrainians living inside and outside the country. Some said they were citizens of other countries who were simply interested in the conflict. It was impossible in some circumstances to verify their identities.', 'Their attacks stand apart from the sophisticated incursions made by nation-state hackers in recent years. While hackers affiliated with the Russian government have quietly infiltrated American government agencies and Fortune 500 companies, these participants have loudly proclaimed their allegiances and used simpler methods to topple or deface websites.', 'And while their tactics appear to have been successful in some instances, security researchers cautioned it was unrealistic to believe cyberattacks by volunteer hackers without specialized technical expertise would play a determinative role in the military campaign on the ground.', '“The land invasion is advancing, people are suffering, buildings are being destroyed,” said Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and a former cyberwarfare adviser for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. “Cyberattacks can’t realistically impact this.”', 'Ukraine has been more deliberate about recruiting a volunteer hacking force. In Telegram channels, participants cheer their collaboration with the government in going after targets such as Sberbank, the Russian state-owned bank.

Army of Ukraine is a 14-page introductory document providing details about how people can participate, including what software to download to mask their whereabouts and identity. Every day, new targets are listed, including websites, telecommunications firms, banks and A.T.M. processors.', 'Yegor Aushev, the co-founder of the Ukrainian cybersecurity company Cyber Unit Technologies, said he was flooded with notes after posting on social media a call for programmers to get involved. His company offered a $100,000 reward for those who identify flaws in the code of Russian cyber targets.', 'Mr. Aushev said there were more than 1,000 people involved in his effort, working in close collaboration with the government. People were only allowed to join if somebody vouched for them. Organized into small groups, they were aiming to hit high-impact targets like infrastructure and logistics systems important to the Russian military.', '“It’s become an independent machine, a distributed international digital army,” Mr. Aushev said. “The biggest hacks against Russia will be soon,” he added, without elaborating.', 'A government spokesman confirmed the work with Mr. Aushev.', 'Figuring out who is behind a cyberattack is always difficult. Groups falsely take credit or boast of a bigger impact than actually occurred. But this week there was a string of attacks against Russian targets. The country’s largest stock exchange, a state-controlled bank and the Russian Foreign Ministry were taken offline for a time after being targeted by Ukraine’s volunteer hackers.', 'On Monday, TripAdvisor and Google Maps halted reviews at some locations in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus after pro-Ukraine volunteers targeted the sites to share uncensored information with the Russian public about the war.', 'On Wednesday, the website of the main Russian intelligence service, the F.S.B., was declared a target by the group. A few hours later, a picture was posted to the I.T. Army Telegram channel showing it had been taken down, a claim that could not be independently verified.', '“They could not overcome your attacks,” the group said on Telegram, a message that was reposted by Mr. Fedorov.', 'The worst fears of military analysts and cybersecurity experts — that Russia would use devastating cyberattacks to take down critical Ukrainian infrastructure like energy, government services and internet access — have not yet occurred.', 'Yet the involvement of nongovernment groups could escalate quickly and cause unintended consequences, experts warned. A malware attack against one target could quickly spill over and become uncontrollable, as it did during a 2017 attack on Ukrainian government and business computer systems. Or a government might mistake an amateur attack for a state-backed one and decide to retaliate.', '“In this quickly escalating situation they are taking steps on behalf of the government that can have very serious repercussions on civilians. This is the big risk,” said Klara Jordan, chief public policy officer at CyberPeace Institute in Geneva.', 'Alex Holden, who founded the cybersecurity firm Hold Security and who has studied Russian ransomware groups, said attacks by volunteers on the Russian government were likely to draw a stiff response.', '“Those that support the Russian government and their invasion in Ukraine are preparing their retaliation against a number of different targets,” Mr. Holden said.', 'Russian forces appear stalled.

Recently, a flurry of campaigns have been started to help Ukrainians after Russia’s invasion. And while there are the occasional GoFundMe scams, and heated political campaigns, most efforts on the site appear to be genuine instances of people helping other people.', 'Tim Cadogan took over as chief executive of GoFundMe just as the pandemic hit. Mr. Cadogan, who grew up in rural England before moving to the United States and assuming leadership roles in the technology industry, disputed the notion that GoFundMe is a substitute for the social safety net. Rather, he said, the company is a complement, a platform to help people act on their innate charitable impulses.', 'And while Mr. Cadogan encourages people to donate to campaigns, he is even more enthusiastic about those who start their own. Besides the fact that it is good for GoFundMe, which is a private, for-profit company, new campaigns, he says, are the most effective way to amplify one’s own philanthropic priorities.', '“If you have an altruistic bone in your body, it’s actually very easy to organize, and it’s sort of a supercharged version of giving,” he says. “By organizing, you multiply yourself, because you kind of add in your friends, your family, your network.

I mean, the job that I do, the industry that I work in, none of it existed. And I had very little exposure to people who ran companies.', 'And what was the first job that made an impact on you?', 'I had a lot of crap jobs, tough jobs. I worked building sites. I worked as a cleaner. I worked moving. Those jobs definitely taught me that I wanted to do something with my mind, because I found myself getting very bored.', 'My first real job in terms of a sort of a professional job was the Boston Consulting Group, and that was a great first job because what it does is it gives you rapid exposure to a whole bunch of industries. What I liked about it was that rapid learning rate, just being able to get immersed in something really quickly and use the abilities that I developed at college to synthesize a lot of information.', 'You were at Yahoo in a number of roles, including advertising, for some of the pivotal years. What do you think was going wrong at the company?', 'Boy, there’s a lot of things. We were offering a lot of different products and that got really complicated. We were competing with Google in search, and I think it’s difficult to be really good at a lot of things. There’s the classic question: What are you going to be very focused on?

We’re born and go through certain experiences, many of them are the same, and ultimately we pass away. What we see is that in those moments of life — they can be hard moments, they could be wonderful moments, they could be getting married, having a baby, going to college — people want to come together, family and friends want to support each other. It’s exactly the case in the hard times. Something difficult happens and pretty much the first thing that anyone who knows you says is: “How can I help?” So that is all still happening, and overlaid on that are all these massive sort of impacts that have been affecting our societies from Covid and social justice and some of these climate effects that you’re seeing, whether they be floods or hurricanes or fires and so on. And it does seem that the rate and intensity of those is increasing at the moment.', 'Do you think the gaps have always been there or are they becoming more common now?', 'The situations that are coming up now seem like they are more frequent. But it’s really important to understand that we don’t think of ourselves as a substitute for social safety nets. What we are is a complement to whatever you’re getting from the government or the institutions in the society that you live in. The thing that we do as well, which is very, very different, is the emotional support that a GoFundMe campaign offers. It’s the fact that your family, your friends, some people in your community that you don’t know, some strangers who aren’t even in your community, would rally around and say: “I’m really sorry this happened. We just want to help you.” We provide a place to convey that.', 'I’ve had just recently a few friends go through some really difficult things in their lives, and in each case, people have put together a GoFundMe.

So that’s how we something we provide is quite distinctive.', 'Is there any inherent contradiction in your mind in GoFundMe being a for-profit corporation?', 'Actually, I think being for profit is what enables us to do what we do and create such a good platform, because we have to run a global, world-class platform service. We have to keep evolving. We have to keep offering new features. We have to really think about the trust and safety side of our business. We have to manage all of the payments. So being for-profit gives us the ability to hire great people and compete with other tech companies for those people and compensate them, but also have that purpose of being able to say, I’m working at a company that’s doing a truly important thing in the world.', 'What are you doing to minimize instances of fraud and abuse on the platform?', 'We live in a society of humans, and the vast majority of people are good and have no ill intent. There are some people that don’t have good intent, but that applies to anyone who runs a big consumer business or even a small business. You can have someone who can try and take something from your shop. So it just tells me that we see human nature, nothing more than that.', 'In terms of how we deal with that, it’s a blend of technology, which is looking for certain signals and flags. And we’ve been doing this for 11 years now, so we’ve seen not quite everything under the sun. And then there’s a trust and safety team that are very well trained and have a really good playbook for what to look for.', 'How do you make sure that the money is actually used effectively? And how do you even judge that?', 'Our job is to make sure that the money gets to the right beneficiary. We put a lot of work into the verification that this is the person that was intended for at the end of the day. Once they have that money, it is their money, and they can make choices. So we don’t have a way to go all the way into what they’re using, the debit card or the credit card to spend the money. It’s pretty rare that we hear of someone doing something completely off the reservation. But at the end of the day, it is their money.', 'Would the world be a better place if GoFundMe didn’t need to exist in the first place?', 'No. Life happens and it has good and bad parts. A fundamental part of being human is wanting to get through it together. That never goes away. And we’re a place where people come together and help each other out. None of us can get through life on our own.', 'How has the way people use the site changed during the pandemic?', 'The first phase was things like P.P.E. People didn’t have face masks. Medical workers didn’t have gloves and so on. All that stuff was running out. Then you started to see lockdowns and therefore countless campaigns for small businesses, for their employees. That was not new to GoFundMe, but the scale of that was completely different. And then as people were out of work for longer, they sought more rent relief and those kinds of things. With the murder of George Floyd, we saw a lot of activity related to the social justice movement.', 'But since the middle of last year, that all is coming down and more normal life is coming up. We’ve seen weddings, we’ve seen animals, we’ve seen honeymoons. We just saw kind of a campaign for the U.S. men’s bobsled team to raise the $100,000 to help them, you know, get ready and go to the Winter Olympics. All the things you could imagine, with humans getting on with their lives.']","['people', 'thing', 'job', 'company', 'money', 'campaign', 'gofundme', 'life', 'lot', 'moment', 'world', 'friend', 'business', 'way', 'place', 'safety', 'platform', 'profit', 'year', 'site']",images/89.png

In many cases, that provider pays for the privilege.', 'The idea is that if tenants have choices for internet service providers — as Americans often do with mobile phone companies or grocery stores — they’re more likely to find the product that they want at a fair price.', 'But all this time, apartment owners and large internet service companies have found ways around the government rules. They have effectively blocked upstart internet companies from many buildings. Regulators know this, but not much has changed.', 'Last month, the F.C.C. took out its pencils again. On paper, people who live in apartments and public housing complexes will have more information and power to pick their own internet provider, no matter what their landlord wants. We’ll see.', 'The government’s failure to achieve in practice what it demands in principle is a microcosm of America’s stinky internet.', 'The U.S. has an illusion of free-market competition in internet service. There’s a lot of government regulation, but it isn’t particularly effective. This double whammy of dysfunction holds back the U.S. economy, wastes taxpayer and consumer money and shuts many Americans out of modern life.', 'The result: Americans pay more for worse internet service than our peers in most rich countries. About 15 million Americans, or more, lack modern internet access; the system is so muddled that we don’t know exactly how many. Many others can’t afford it.', 'There is a sense of urgency to fix these problems. The pandemic has awakened more U.S. policymakers and the public to the necessity of internet service and the ways in which the current system fails us. Fresh congressional funding and changes in technology are enabling new approaches to connecting Americans.', 'This momentum will be wasted, however, if government officials can’t enforce the rules of competition, including for the roughly one-third of Americans who live in apartments.', 'The F.C.C. apartment rules are “a cautionary tale,” said Greg Guice, director of government affairs for the public interest group Public Knowledge. “If you’re going to say you’re fixing a problem, then you need to make sure you’re fixing the problem.”', 'In apartments, internet service providers need building owners’ permission to install their equipment to hook up tenants. In theory, landlords must have a good excuse to say no. They often don’t.', 'Genna Veksler, co-founder of the small internet provider Brooklyn Fiber, told me that he regularly receives calls from potential customers in apartment buildings but is turned down by property managers who cite a list of objections.', 'They worry about construction dust or disruption from installing a new company’s internet lines — although Veksler said that Brooklyn Fiber could wire homes with relatively little fuss. Building officials also say that tenants don’t need more than one internet option.', 'Veksler doesn’t bother raising the F.C.C.’s rules with landlords because Brooklyn Fiber doesn’t have the money to handle it the American way: by hiring lawyers. “That’s not a fight we can win; therefore, it’s not a fight worth waging,” Veksler said.', 'Veksler, Guice and others who want better and more fair internet service in the U.S. are nevertheless cautiously optimistic that the F.C.C. can give apartment residents more choices, if the agency has bite behind its rules.', 'After San Francisco passed a law in 2016 tightening rules for tenants’ internet choices, city attorneys made it clear what the potential penalties were if apartment owners didn’t comply, said Ernesto Falcon, senior legislative counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. The punishments included lawsuits that could be filed by the city, service providers or tenants. It seemed to work.', 'After two years of urgency and action, people who are hardened by years of U.S. internet dysfunction are torn between hope and pessimism.', '“Big change like this doesn’t come fast, and it’s never easy,” said Virginia Lam Abrams, who oversees government affairs for the internet provider Starry.

Named the Ghost of Kyiv, the ace fighter had apparently single-handedly shot down several Russian fighter jets.', 'The story was shared by the official Ukraine Twitter account on Sunday in a thrilling montage video set to thumping music, showing the fighter swooping through the Ukrainian skies as enemy planes exploded around him. The Security Service of Ukraine, the country’s main security agency, also relayed the tale on its official Telegram channel, which has over 700,000 subscribers.', 'The story of a single pilot’s beating the superior Russian air force found wide appeal online, thanks to the official Ukraine accounts and many others. Videos of the so-called Ghost of Kyiv had more than 9.3 million views on Twitter, and the flier was mentioned in thousands of Facebook groups reaching up to 717 million followers. On YouTube, videos promoting the Ukrainian fighter collected 6.5 million views, while TikTok videos with the hashtag #ghostofkyiv reached 200 million views.', 'There was just one problem: The Ghost of Kyiv may be a myth.', 'While there are reports of some Russian planes that were destroyed in combat, there is no information linking them to a single Ukrainian pilot. One of the first videos that went viral, which was included in the montage shared by the official Ukraine Twitter account, was a computer rendering from a combat flight simulator originally uploaded by a YouTube user with just 3,000 subscribers. And a photo supposedly confirming the fighter’s existence, shared by a former president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, was from a 2019 Twitter post by the Ukrainian defense ministry.', 'When the fact-checking website Snopes published an article debunking the video, some social media users pushed back.', '“Why can’t we just let people believe some things?” one Twitter user replied. “If the Russians believe it, it brings fear. If the Ukrainians believe it, it gives them hope.”', 'In the information war over the invasion of Ukraine, some of the country’s official accounts have pushed stories with questionable veracity, spreading anecdotes, gripping on-the-ground accounts and even some unverified information that was later proved false, in a rapid jumble of fact and myth.', 'The claims by Ukraine do not compare to the falsehoods being spread by Russia, which laid the groundwork for a “false flag” operation in the lead-up to the invasion, which the Biden administration sought to derail. As the invasion neared, Russia falsely claimed that it was responding to Ukrainian aggression and liberating citizens from fascists and neo-Nazis. And since the assault began, Russia made baseless claims that Ukrainians had indiscriminately bombed hospitals and killed civilians.', 'Instead, Ukraine’s online propaganda is largely focused on its heroes and martyrs, characters who help dramatize tales of\xa0Ukrainian fortitude and Russian aggression. ', 'But the Ukrainian claims on social media have also raised thorny questions about how false and unproven content should be handled during war — when lives are at stake and a Western ally is fighting for its survival against a powerful invading force.', '“Ukraine is involved in pretty classic propaganda,” said Laura Edelson, a computer scientist studying misinformation at New York University. “They are telling stories that support their narrative. Sometimes false information is making its way in there, too, and more of it is getting through because of the overall environment.”', 'Anecdotes detailing Ukrainian bravery or Russian brutality are crucial to the country’s war plan, according to experts, and they are part of established war doctrine that values winning not just individual skirmishes but also the hearts and minds of citizens and international observers.', 'That is especially important during this conflict, as Ukrainians try to keep morale high among the fighters and marshal global support for their cause.', '“If Ukraine had no messages of the righteousness of its cause, the popularity of its cause, the valor of its heroes, the suffering of its populace, then it would lose,” said Peter W. Singer, a strategist and senior fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington. “Not just the information war, but it would lose the overall war.”', 'In previous wars, combatants would try to sabotage enemy communication and limit the spread of wartime propaganda, even cutting physical communication lines like telegraph cables. But there are fewer such cables in the internet age, so in addition to downing communication towers and disrupting pockets of internet access, the modern strategy involves flooding the internet with viral messages that drown out opposing narratives.', 'That digital battle moved at startling speed, experts noted, using an array of social media accounts, official websites and news conferences streamed online to spread Ukraine’s message.', '“You have to have the message that goes the most viral,” Mr. Singer said.', 'That was the case with another report from Ukraine involving a remarkable confrontation on Snake Island, an outpost in the Black Sea. According to an audio recording released by Pravda, a Ukrainian newspaper, and later verified by Ukraine officials, 13 border guards were offered a frightening ultimatum by an advancing Russian military unit: Surrender or face an attack. The Ukrainians responded instead with an expletive, before apparently being killed.', 'Audio of the exchange went viral on social media, and the clip posted on Feb. 24 by Pravda received more than 3.5 million views on YouTube. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine personally announced the deaths in a video, saying each guard would be awarded the title Hero of Ukraine.', 'But just days later, Ukrainian officials confirmed in a Facebook post that the men were still alive, taken prisoner by Russian forces.', 'Social media has become the main conduit for pushing the information, verified or not, giving tech companies a role in the information war, too. The fake Ghost of Kyiv video, for instance, was flagged as “out of context” by Twitter, but the montage posted to Ukraine’s official Twitter account received no such flag. The false photo posted by Mr. Poroshenko, the former Ukrainian president, also had no flag.', 'While Twitter monitors its service for harmful content, including manipulated or mislabeled videos, it said tweets simply mentioning the Ghost of Kyiv did not violate its rules.', '“When we identify content and accounts that violate the Twitter Rules, we’ll take enforcement action,” the company said.', 'In exercising discretion over how unverified or false content is moderated, social media companies have decided to “pick a side,” said Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and a former head of security at Facebook.', 'Russian forces appear stalled. With Russia’s advance on Ukraine’s major cities stalled and satellite imagery showing soldiers digging into defensive positions around Kyiv, a consensus is emerging in the West that the war has reached a bloody stalemate.', 'Mariupol is still suffering. Russian forces continued to bombard the besieged coastal city, hitting a\xa0drama school\xa0where 400 people were hiding, according to local officials. The city’s mayor said thousands of residents had been forcibly deported to Russia.', 'A Ukrainian base is hit. A missile attack on barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv killed more than 40 marines, a Ukrainian official said. That would make it one of the single deadliest attacks on Ukrainian forces since the start of the war, and the death toll could be much higher.', 'Putin does not want direct negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly called for direct negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the hope of ending the war, but Mr. Putin does not think the time is right for talks, according to a senior Turkish official.', '“I think this demonstrates the limits of ‘fact-checking’ in a fast-moving battle with real lives at stake,” Mr. Stamos said. He added that technology platforms never created rules against misinformation overall, instead targeting specific behaviors, actors and content.', 'That leaves the truth behind some wartime narratives, like an apparent assassination plot against Mr. Zelensky or simply the number of troops killed in battle, fairly elusive, even as official accounts and news media share the information.', 'Those narratives have continued as the war marches on, revealing the contours of an information war aimed not just at Western audiences but also at Russian citizens. At the United Nations on Monday, the Ukrainian ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, shared a series of text messages that he said had been retrieved from the phone of a dead Russian soldier.', '“Mama, I’m in Ukraine. There is a real war raging here. I’m afraid,” the Russian soldier apparently wrote, according to Mr. Kyslytsya’s account, which he read in Russian. The tale seemed to evoke a narrative advanced by officials and shared extensively on social media that Russian soldiers are poorly trained and too young, and don’t want to be fighting their Ukrainian neighbors. “We are bombing all of the cities together, even targeting civilians.”', 'The story, whether true or not, appears tailor-made for Russian civilians — particularly parents fretting over the fate of their enlisted children, experts said.', '“This is an age-old tactic that the Ukrainians are trying to use, and that is to draw the attention of the mothers and the families in Russia away from the more grandiose aims for war onto, instead, the human costs of war,” said Ian Garner, a historian focusing on Russia who has followed Russian-language propaganda during the conflict. “We know that this is really effective.”', 'Official Ukrainian accounts have also uploaded dozens of videos purportedly showing Russian prisoners of war, some with bloody bandages covering their arms or face. In the videos, the prisoners are heard denouncing the invasion. The videos may raise questions about whether Ukraine is violating the Geneva Conventions, which has rules about sharing images of war prisoners.', 'Russia has also engaged in its own form of mythmaking, but experts say it has been far less effective. Rather than targeting international observers with emotional appeals, Russia has focused on swaying its own population to build support for the battle, Dr. Garner said.', 'Since Russian state media is still calling the conflict a “special military operation” and not a war — in line with the description used by President Vladimir V. Putin — state broadcasters are left “trying to talk about a war that is apparently not happening,” Dr. Garner said.', 'The Russian government “can’t play to its strongest narratives of individual sacrifice,” he added, instead relying on stories of Ukrainians bombing hospitals and civilians, providing no evidence.', 'Ukraine’s efforts to amplify its own messages also leave little room for Russia to dominate the conversation, said Mr. Singer, the strategist from New America.', '“A key to information warfare in the age of social media is to recognize that the audience is both target of and participant in it,” he said. He added that social media users were “hopefully sharing out those messages, which makes them combatants of a sort as well.”', 'Audio produced by Adrienne Hurst.']","['Ukraine', 'war', 'video', 'medium', 'Russia', 'account', 'information', 'Twitter', 'message', 'story', 'narrative', 'force', 'official', 'fighter', 'invasion', 'content', 'city', 'view', 'civilian', 'propaganda']",images/97.png

Obviously.”', 'So says Mark LaNeve, a longtime auto executive who, after a brief retirement, threw his lot in with Charge Enterprises. With the trickle of electric vehicles hitting American roads poised to become a steadier flow this year, his company is betting on the business that will help charge those vehicles. It is offering a nationwide soup-to-nuts service that provides siting, planning, permitting and construction of E.V. charging stations.', '“Tesla’s been dominant, but now everybody else is getting into the fray,” said Mr. LaNeve, who is 62 and based in Detroit. “And there’s a lot of excitement around the new Hummer, Mustang Mach-E, Ford Lightning, the Silverado and Rivians. People are starting to pay attention to the chargers, too. But no one pays any attention to this: You’ve got to install this stuff. You’ve got to engineer it, and we think it’s a huge business if done right and done at scale.”', 'Mr. LaNeve made his bones in an industry powered by fossil fuels. A onetime C-suite sales and marketing star at Cadillac and Ford and, for three years, Volvo’s North American chief executive, he joined Charge last year. The company, based in New York, has expanded its initial focus — building out wireless communications infrastructure — with its E.V. push.', '“I basically ran sales and marketing at General Motors and Ford — Big Three, Fortune 100 companies — and enjoyed it immensely,” Mr. LaNeve, now Charge’s president, said during a recent interview. “Got to do things I never dreamed of, frankly. But about four years ago, we had a Tesla in the fleet at Ford. As a kind of a traditional war horse in the auto industry, I didn’t want to like it. I’m like, ‘What’s going on here?’ And I had it for about three days and, I’ve got to tell you, I freaking loved it. And I told everybody there, ‘Guys, this is the future.’”', 'Rick Wagoner, the former G.M. chairman who is on the board of ChargePoint Holdings, which operates charging stations nationally, introduced Mr. LaNeve to Andrew Fox, one of Charge’s founders and its chief executive. Mr. LaNeve sensed an opportunity.', 'The $7.5 billion allocated for charging stations in the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by Congress last year, he said, only increased his optimism.', 'With carmakers and state and federal government entities increasingly looking to combat carbon emissions with electric vehicles, one of the major sticking points to their widespread adoption remains the nation’s undersized and spotty charging infrastructure. That concern was reflected in the infrastructure bill’s call for 500,000 additional E.V. chargers.', 'According to the Energy Department, there are roughly 50,000 (overnight or workday) Level 2 charger locations in service in the United States and Canada, and about 7,000 Level 3 fast charger locations, of which 1,400 are part of Tesla’s supercharging network. (Level 1 charging for the current and future generations of E.V.s is painfully slow.)', 'Mr. Fox, who founded the company in 2003 with Craig Denson and Kenneth Orr, compared the current moment in E.V. charging to one that faced cellphone makers 35-plus years ago. “Just as cellphone utilization was starting out — when utilization was relatively low and they were still a novelty item — over the next 30 years we believe that the infrastructure for E.V. charging is going to mimic the range coverage that you have now with the cellphone industry,” he said.', 'Samuel Abuelsamid, principal analyst with Guidehouse Insights, an advisory firm specializing in infrastructure, concurs with that assessment. “There’s certainly a big, addressable market for this type of service,” he said. “This whole area is something that’s going to be critically important, as you’ve got all these automakers making huge plans to build and hopefully sell millions of E.V.s in the next five to 10 years.”', 'While many current E.V. owners tend to be affluent and can arrange to do most of their charging off street and overnight in their own garages with slower Level 2 chargers, Mr. Abuelsamid noted, “the vast majority of Americans don’t ever buy a new vehicle in their lifetime — about three and a half times as many used vehicles are sold every year as new.”', '“As you grow the E.V. market, more of them move into the used vehicle market,” he continued. “A lot of these customers are not going to be able to charge at home. They will need public charging infrastructure. So you need to build that out. And companies like Charge are going to be important — helping to figure out where can you locate chargers, especially for DC fast charging, where you need quite a bit of electrical capacity going into the location.”', 'Securing regulatory approvals and reliable local contractors is also necessary, he said.', 'Deciding to piggyback charging onto Charge’s cellular communications business was a crucial move, said Mr. Fox, 49.', '“E.V. charging is a separate infrastructure, but we didn’t want to vaporize a ton of investor dollars to build this business,” he said. “And so we’ve acquired companies that were providing infrastructure services for telecommunication, because it turns out maybe it’s not the exact same worker, but it’s the same type of work, running cables.”', 'Reporting revenue of $357 million in the first three quarters of 2021, Charge now trades over the counter (as CRGE) but is uplisting to Nasdaq. In January, Charge also added EV Group Holdings, which focuses on real estate assets for commercial fleet operators needing charging depots, to its portfolio.', 'Like Mr. LaNeve, who grew up as the son and grandson of steelworkers in Beaver Falls, Pa., Mr. Fox, raised in Queens, credits blue-collar roots — his father was a union electrician — for his approach to business.', '“We want to service and pull the whole country into E.V.,” he said. “And so we’ve got this unglamorous work to do.”', 'Mr. Fox and Mr. LaNeve anticipate that eight million to 10 million chargers will be installed across the country over the next 15 or so years. They foresee a constantly changing parade of new technologies and a broad array of places where charging stations might be located, including hotels, supermarkets, health clubs and office buildings.', '“There’s going to be a lot of interesting partners and models” that emerge, Mr. LaNeve said. “But if you think about a gas station,” he said, “it’s got 10 pumps. When do they make a move that two of those become fast chargers?”', 'The executives readily concede that many of today’s charging stations are inadequate, with inconvenient siting, broken equipment and frequent outages.', '“As a Tesla owner myself, I can tell you that there’s a lot of friction” at non-Tesla charging stations, Mr. Fox said. “It’s like if you were trying to use a cellphone to go cross-country 30 years ago. You got expensive charges for roaming, you got dropped calls.”', 'The company acknowledges E.V. critics’ oft-repeated concern that the U.S. energy grid will struggle to power a nation of electrified vehicles, but it is confident that solutions will emerge.', '“Renewables will help, but I think that the other big part of this is, is just the sheer volume of wasted energy in our current system,” Mr. Fox said. “If we could solve for that problem, we’ll have plenty of power in the grid. This is a political point, but it’s not like we’re going to turn it all on tomorrow; it will happen gradually over the next 25, 30 years.” Advances in battery storage technology are particularly important, he said.', 'Again harking back to their humble beginnings, they have further ambitions.', '“The premise around what we’re doing,” Mr. Fox said, “is creating high-quality jobs. You can’t outsource the work that we’re doing to a foreign country. It has to be done locally. And so we can make our stakeholders’ lives better.

Or you have a question about travel arrangements or insurance coverage. You go to the company’s website and a digital imp pops up in a small text window. “How can I help you?” it asks. Or you call a customer service number and a chirpy automaton asks the same thing.', 'Gamely, you go ahead, typing or telling the chatbot what you want. Its formulaic replies are off the mark. It doesn’t really understand you. Several wayward linguistic volleys later, you give up in despair.', 'That experience is so common that customer service experts have a name for it: “the spiral of misery.”', 'But there is good news. Customer service chatbots are becoming less robotic. And they are on a path to improve significantly over the next several years, according to researchers, industry executives and analysts, pulled along by advances in artificial intelligence. They will become more intelligent, more conversational, more humanlike and, most important, more helpful.', '“Even now, there are times you sort of can’t tell it’s not a human,” said Bern Elliot, an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm. “It’s not as good as you’d like, but it is moving in that direction. And innovation is occurring at a rapid pace.”', 'In research projects, A.I. has delivered amazing feats of understanding and producing language, known as natural language processing. A.I. software can write stories and poems, answer trivia questions, translate dozens of languages, and has even created computer programs. These projects typically have all but unlimited computing power and tap unlimited volumes of readily accessible data across the web.', 'Consumer digital assistant software, like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa, also roams the wide-open web to answer questions.', 'But for most companies, everything is more constrained. Their customer information, needed to answer questions, is not on the web but resides inside corporate data centers. They have less data than the internet giants, and it has accumulated over years, stored in different formats, in different places. (A.I. algorithms struggle without ample data.) It’s more a geological dig than an internet scan.', 'Tackling that challenge has become an emerging and increasingly crowded market, called conversational A.I. Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle have offerings, as do smaller companies and start-ups including Kore.ai, Omilia, Rasa, Senseforth.ai, Verint and Yellow.ai.', 'The suppliers provide software tools that companies then customize and train on their own data.', 'This year, the business market for virtual assistants — a.k.a. chatbots — will grow 15 percent to more than $7 billion, according to a Gartner prediction. Some of those bots are designed to assist employees, but most are for customer service.', 'No company has made a more humbling and instructive journey to its chatbot technology than IBM. After its Watson supercomputer triumphed over human champions in the TV game show “Jeopardy!” about a decade ago, IBM set about applying Watson’s natural language processing to other fields. An early focus was the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and IBM called health care its “moonshot.”', 'In January, after struggling for years, IBM announced it was selling off its Watson Health business to a private equity firm. A few days later, Gartner rated IBM’s Watson Assistant a “leader” in conversational A.I. for business. Watson has gone from cancer moonshots to customer service chatbots.', 'Today Watson Assistant is a success story for IBM among its remaining A.I. products, which include software for exploring data and automating business tasks. Watson Assistant has evolved over years, being steadily refined and improved. IBM fairly quickly learned that a rigid question-and-answer approach, though ideal for a game show, was too limited and inflexible in customer service settings.', '“The real world opened our eyes,” said Aya Soffer, a vice president for A.I. technologies at IBM Research.', 'The starting point for improvement, Dr. Soffer said, has been a deeper understanding of what happens in call-centers, working with other companies to mine and analyze many thousands of calls between customers and human agents. In dialogues, for example, tracking which questions and which follow-ups led to resolving a customer’s problem, she said, and what were the telltale signals of “conversations that went bad.”', 'Early chatbots were programmed with a predetermined set of questions and answers. But that led to dead ends if the software did not understand the questions. Today, Dr. Soffer said, much of the recent innovation lies in “teaching the system to understand and tease out a person’s intent.”', 'Creating software that can determine the essence of a person’s inquiry is a central challenge. “You assume there are only so many ways a person can say something, but you learn that is not really true,” said Bob Beatty, chief experience officer for G.M. Financial.', 'Initially, the financial services arm of General Motors had a rudimentary chatbot that simply delivered canned answers to a set list of questions. But it began working with IBM in 2019 to develop an interactive chatbot. G.M. Financial had a two-year plan to develop and roll out its chatbot, powered by Watson Assistant.', 'The coronavirus pandemic lockdowns in March 2020 meant a surprise acceleration of that timetable. Mr. Beatty sent home the 700 or so agents who worked at the company’s call centers in Arlington, Texas and Chandler, Ariz. While rushing to equip the call center agents for remote work, G.M. Financial, with emails and a notice on its website, steered customers toward its nascent chatbot rather than the phone.', 'The chatbot struggled at first. But the G.M. Financial developers and IBM engineers programmed in the ability to answer more and more inquiries — no matter how they were phrased — like, “What is my payoff amount?” or “Did you receive my March payment?”', 'Even simple questions require personalized answers that the software has to look up in a company database, though. At the start, the chatbot called Nanci (its name is within the word “financial”) was resolving less than 10 percent of customer inquiries. But within two months, the success rate rose to 50 percent — and is now at 60 percent, according to G.M. Financial.', 'So far, Nanci has been a text-only chatbot, but the company is adding a voice version. And it is working with IBM to automate more complex tasks like changing payment and due dates.', 'The main purpose of the chatbot technology, Mr. Beatty said, is to improve the customer experience and nurture brand loyalty for its parent company, General Motors. But the average call-center inquiry lasts six minutes and costs $16, according to industry estimates. At G.M. Financial, many customer questions are now answered by the chatbot. In January, Mr. Beatty estimated, the company saved a total of $935,000.', 'So far, call-center staff has not been trimmed. The technology, Mr. Beatty said, will allow agents to spend more time on difficult problems — for example, speaking to a customer who has lost a job and needs to extend a car lease or loan.', '“That’s something a trained, empathetic team member can do in a way A.I. cannot,” he said.', 'For most businesses, a hurdle to progress with A.I. is not having enough training data. Modern A.I. software requires vast amounts of data to pore through to improve its accuracy — to learn, in its way. Some new A.I. technology may be able to overcome that obstacle by automatically generating more training data or to learn from lesser amounts of data.', 'Anthem, a major health insurer covering more than 45 million people, has no shortage of data, and it also has a technology staff of a few thousand including data scientists, A.I. experts and applications developers. IBM’s Watson Assistant is one of many tools Anthem uses.', 'Anthem shows what is happening now with A.I.-fueled chatbots — but also what might be possible in a few years. Its current technology, including its mobile app, is called Sydney and is 90 percent accurate in answering questions about co-payments (“I’m getting a knee replacement. How much does my insurance cover?”) and medications (“Does my prescription have any drug-drug interactions?”), according to the company.', 'But the long-term goal, said Rajeev Ronanki, president of digital platforms at Anthem, is to use A.I. to sift through all its claims and clinical data to deliver personalized health advice. And other data: Sydney can even upload fitness tracker information.', 'There are, for example, more than 380 care and treatment options for people with diabetes, Mr. Ronanki said. What are the diet, exercise and medication regimens that have produced the best results for similar patients — by age, gender, other conditions and medical history?', 'That information could be delivered as treatment guidelines to a physician and as health advice to an individual through an increasingly intelligent and conversational chatbot.', 'A.I., Mr. Ronanki said, can “help us move from reactive sick care to proactive, predictive and personalized health care.”', 'And a solution, perhaps, to the spiral of misery.']","['chatbot', 'datum', 'customer', 'company', 'A.I.', 'question', 'IBM', 'Watson', 'technology', 'software', 'year', 'service', 'center', 'G.M.', 'Financial', 'Beatty', 'percent', 'answer', 'business', 'health']",images/101.png

Adapto-what-nows?', '“It makes your soda $6 instead of $2,” Mr. Rubin explained.', 'He was joking, but it was a decent metaphor for the organization, and for the state of cryptocurrency, as a whole. Like most things in the crypto world these days, Friends With Benefits — a group that has been compared to a “decentralized Soho House” and a V.I.P. lounge for crypto’s creative class — is succeeding at generating hype and making money.', 'But its rise has onlookers wondering whether proponents of web3 — a vision of a new internet, organized on decentralized databases known as blockchains — are building something of real value, or whether it’s mostly just overpriced fizz.', 'Friends With Benefits is what’s known as a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO — a kind of digital co-op that uses cryptocurrency tokens to coordinate access, make payments and vote on group decisions.', 'DAOs, which have been described as “financial flash mobs” or “group chats with bank accounts,” are among the fastest-growing parts of the crypto ecosystem. There are thousands of DAOs organized around a variety of causes, from managing decentralized crypto exchanges to bidding on historic copies of the Constitution. The largest DAOs have thousands of members, and some control billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency.', 'Friends With Benefits is not the biggest DAO, but it has become one of the buzziest. It has nearly 6,000 unique token holders, including musicians like Erykah Badu and Azealia Banks. Last year, it raised $10 million from investors such as the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz in a funding round that valued it at $100 million.', 'The group was started in 2020 when Trevor McFedries, a digital entrepreneur, got the idea for an online club for his friends in the art and music worlds, with a private chat room that they would use special cryptocurrency tokens to unlock.', '“I wanted a place for my creative peers who were so skeptical of tech and finance to have a little light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.', 'Mr. McFedries’s theory — which he tested by creating a token called $FWB and sending it to some of his Twitter followers — was that attaching cryptocurrency to an online social club would give members an incentive to make it a fun, interesting place to hang out. The more fun people were having, he thought, the more newcomers would want to join, and the more valuable their tokens would become.', 'With Friends With Benefits, “what you’re getting is vibes,” he said. “This token is starting to reflect some of the value of those vibes.”', 'The group’s rapid growth soon attracted investors, who saw Friends With Benefits less as a fully formed start-up than a crowd of crypto enthusiasts from which the next great web3 ventures might emerge. In a blog post announcing its investment, Andreessen Horowitz compared the group to the merchants of 13th-century Venice and the Homebrew Computer Club, the Silicon Valley hobbyist group where Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak debuted the Apple computer in 1976.', '“This is like being able to sit in 2005, web2 era, and be part of a community that has the chance to build the next Facebook or Twitter,” said Steve Jang, the founder and managing partner of Kindred Ventures, which invested $1.5 million in Friends With Benefits.', 'To join, applicants are vetted by a committee of current members. If approved — only about 20 percent are — they receive certain perks based on how many of the group’s in-house $FWB token they own.', 'Members with at least one $FWB token (current price: about $45) can read the group’s newsletter and blog posts. Local membership, which requires holding at least five tokens, comes with limited access to the group’s chat rooms on Discord, a talking and texting app, as well as entry to offline events. Global membership costs 75 $FWB — roughly $3,400 today — and includes access to all Discord chat rooms. (Friends With Benefits lent a Times reporter five $FWB tokens in order to view the Discord chats; those tokens have been returned, and the reporter does not have a stake in the organization.)', 'The group has chapters in New York, Los Angeles and London, but its real headquarters is its Discord server, where members swap outfit-of-the-day photos on the #selfies-n-fits channel, share financial advice on #trading-stonks and #taxes, and debate new proposals for community governance, such as a recent proposal to spend $20,000 from the group’s treasury to develop a members-only subscription coffee service. (As with most DAOs, major group decisions are voted on by token holders and recorded permanently on the Ethereum blockchain.)', 'Culturally, the membership skews less “Lamborghini-driving Bitcoin bros” and more “D.J.s from Williamsburg who dabble in Ethereum on the weekend.” In a recent orientation session, new members introduced themselves: an intellectual-property lawyer, a poet-slash-investor, a brand strategist for Nike, a handful of musicians and software engineers.', '“We’re kind of the anti-crypto crypto club,” Raihan Anwar, a founder of Friends With Benefits, told the newbies.', 'Being organized as a DAO, rather than a traditional corporation, has advantages. The group can easily take stakes in members’ projects, or reward them with $FWB tokens for contributing useful work. Members can leave anytime by selling their tokens. And if the price of $FWB rises, every member stands to benefit.', 'But attaching a community to a volatile crypto token has risks. Last year, a service that Friends With Benefits used to create its tokens was hacked. $FWB’s value plunged 99 percent. The community voted to issue a replacement token and avoided a total collapse. Still, $FWB tokens now trade at around $50, roughly 75 percent lower than their peak.', 'Alex Zhang, 26 — a former concert promoter who serves as the group’s top leader, or “mayor” — acknowledged that the drop in $FWB’s price had worried some of the group’s leaders.', '“It’s the elephant in the room,” he said. “We’re like, is this indicative of our performance?”', 'But he said owning a token together had given members a reason to cooperate to solve problems, rather than infighting or jostling for power.', '“There’s so much value being created right now in FWB,” Mr. Zhang said. “People are launching NFT projects together, they’re starting companies together. The value of friendships — that’s all now being captured by the network.”', 'Mr. Zhang, who described the group as a “headless media community lifestyle brand,” predicts that members will eventually release dozens of projects under the Friends With Benefits umbrella, including magazines, music festivals and apparel lines.', 'A glossary.

Last year, members voted to remove Cooper Turley, a crypto-world influencer, after decade-old, bigoted tweets of his surfaced.', 'And some members have struggled to reconcile the utopian rhetoric of crypto — a tool for democratizing the financial system and removing gatekeepers and middlemen, supposedly — with the reality of an exclusive members club that costs thousands of dollars to join.', '“Social clubs are one thing with expected elitism, but at least they don’t front like they’re inclusive,” said Amelia Elle, a New York fashion designer. She joined the group after hearing that influential artists and creatives were involved but said spending time in the group’s Discord server had been disappointing.', '“If we actually look at the active channels, it’s a lot of men in start-ups who play an instrument or two,” she said.', 'Mr. Zhang acknowledged that “crypto inherently has a level of exclusivity to it.” But he said the group prided itself on being more accessible, and more diverse, than most crypto-focused spaces.', '“We as a community have prioritized and put forth many initiatives to be as inclusive toward individuals that match our values as possible,” he said.', 'So far, most of what Friends With Benefits has produced has been geared toward throwing parties and growing its membership, but it is beginning to branch out. The group is developing a member directory with customizable NFT name badges, planning a music festival and starting a fellowship program for web3 creators from underrepresented backgrounds.', 'In December, members voted to invest $18,530 from the DAO’s treasury to develop the yerba maté drink, its first physical product. Once the drink is ready, they plan to promote it at Friends With Benefits events before selling to a broader audience.', 'The group is also in talks to buy a stake in a defunct Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles, which it plans to turn into a hub.

The threat center, north of Seattle, had been on high alert, and it quickly picked apart the malware, named it “FoxBlade” and notified Ukraine’s top cyberdefense authority. Within three hours, Microsoft’s virus detection systems had been updated to block the code, which erases — “wipes” — data on computers in a network.', 'Then Tom Burt, the senior Microsoft executive who oversees the company’s effort to counter major cyberattacks, contacted Anne Neuberger, the White House’s deputy national security adviser for cyber- and emerging technologies. Ms. Neuberger asked if Microsoft would consider sharing details of the code with the Baltics, Poland and other European nations, out of fear that the malware would spread beyond Ukraine’s borders, crippling the military alliance or hitting West European banks.', 'Before midnight in Washington, Ms. Neuberger had made introductions — and Microsoft had begun playing the role that Ford Motor Company did in World War II, when the company converted automobile production lines to make Sherman tanks.', 'After years of discussions in Washington and in tech circles about the need for public-private partnerships to combat destructive cyberattacks, the war in Ukraine is stress-testing the system. The White House, armed with intelligence from the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, is overseeing classified briefings on Russia’s cyberoffensive plans. Even if American intelligence agencies picked up on the kind of crippling cyberattacks that someone — presumably Russian intelligence agencies or hackers — threw at Ukraine’s government, they do not have the infrastructure to move that fast to block them.', '“We are a company and not a government or a country,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, noted in a blog post issued by the company on Monday, describing the threats it was seeing. But the role it is playing, he made clear, is not a neutral one. He wrote about “constant and close coordination” with the Ukrainian government, as well as federal officials, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union.', '“I’ve never seen it work quite this way, or nearly this fast,” Mr. Burt said. “We are doing in hours now what, even a few years ago, would have taken weeks or months.”', 'The intelligence is flowing in many directions.', 'Company executives, some newly armed with security clearances, are joining secure calls to hear an array of briefings organized by the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, along with British authorities, among others. But much of the actionable intelligence is being found by companies like Microsoft and Google, who can see what is flowing across their vast networks.', 'Mr. Biden’s aides often note that it was a private firm — Mandiant — that found the “SolarWinds” attack 15 months ago, in which one of Russia’s most cybersavvy intelligence agencies, the S.V.R., infiltrated network management software used by thousands of U.S. government agencies and private businesses. That gave the Russian government unfettered access.', 'Such attacks have given Russia a reputation as one of the most aggressive, and skilled, cyberpowers. But the surprise of recent days is that Russia’s activity in that realm has been more muted than expected, researchers said.', 'Most early tabletop exercises about a Russian invasion started with overwhelming cyberattacks, taking out the internet in Ukraine and perhaps the power grid. So far, that hasn’t happened.', '“Many people are quite surprised that there isn’t significant integration of cyberattacks into the overall campaign that Russia is undertaking in Ukraine,” said Shane Huntley, the director of Google’s threat analysis group. “This is mostly business as normal as to the levels of Russian targeting.”', 'Mr. Huntley said Google regularly observes some Russian attempts to hack accounts of people in Ukraine. “The normal level is actually never zero,” he said. But those attempts have not markedly increased in the past several days, as Russia has invaded Ukraine.', '“We have seen some Russian activity targeting Ukraine; it just hasn’t been the big sets,” said Ben Read, a director at the security firm Mandiant.', 'It is not clear to American or European officials why Russia held off.', 'It could be that they tried but defenses were stronger than they anticipated, or that the Russians wanted to reduce the risk of attacking civilian infrastructure, so that a puppet government they installed would not struggle to rule the country.', 'But American officials said a massive cyberattack by Russia on Ukraine — or beyond, in retaliation for the economic and technology sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe — is hardly off the table. Some speculate that just as Moscow steps up its indiscriminate bombing, it will seek to cause as much economic disruption as it can muster.', 'The longer and more effectively the Ukrainian resistance holds out against Russia’s army, the more Moscow could be tempted to begin using “the armada of Russian cyberforces,” Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview last week.', 'Meta, the parent company of Facebook, disclosed on Sunday that it had discovered hackers taking over accounts belonging to Ukrainian military officials and public figures. The hackers tried to use their access to these accounts to spread disinformation, posting videos that purported to show the Ukrainian military surrendering. Meta responded by locking down the accounts and alerting the users who had been targeted.', 'Russian forces appear stalled. With Russia’s advance on Ukraine’s major cities stalled and satellite imagery showing soldiers digging into defensive positions around Kyiv, a consensus is emerging in the West that the war has reached a bloody stalemate.', 'Mariupol is still suffering. Russian forces continued to bombard the besieged coastal city, hitting a\xa0drama school\xa0where 400 people were hiding, according to local officials. The city’s mayor said thousands of residents had been forcibly deported to Russia.', 'A Ukrainian base is hit. A missile attack on barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv killed more than 40 marines, a Ukrainian official said. That would make it one of the single deadliest attacks on Ukrainian forces since the start of the war, and the death toll could be much higher.', 'Putin does not want direct negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly called for direct negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the hope of ending the war, but Mr. Putin does not think the time is right for talks, according to a senior Turkish official.', 'Twitter said it had found signs that hackers attempted to compromise accounts on its platform, and YouTube said it had removed five channels that posted videos used in the disinformation campaign.', 'Meta executives said the Facebook hackers were affiliated with a group known as Ghostwriter, which security researchers believe to be associated with Belarus.', 'Ghostwriter is known for its strategy of hacking public figures’ email accounts, then using that access to compromise their social media accounts as well. The group has been “heavily active” in Ukraine during the past two months, said Mr. Read, who researches the group.', 'While U.S. officials do not currently assess any direct threat to the United States from stepped-up Russian cyberoperations, that calculation could change.', 'U.S. and European sanctions are biting harder than expected. Mr. Warner said that Russia could respond “with either direct cyberattacks against NATO countries or, more likely, in effect unleashing all of the Russian cybercriminals on ransomware attacks at a massive level that still allows them some deniability of responsibility.”', 'Russian ransomware criminal groups conducted a devastating series of attacks in the U.S. last year against hospitals, a meat-processing company and most notably, the company that operates gasoline pipelines along the East Coast. While Russia has taken steps to rein in those groups in recent months — after months of meetings between Ms. Neuberger and her Russian counterpart, Moscow conducted some high-profile arrests in January — it could easily reverse its crackdown efforts.', 'But President Biden has stepped up his warnings to Russia against any sort of cyberattack on the United States.', '“If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond,” Mr. Biden said on Thursday.', 'It was the third time Mr. Biden had issued such a warning since winning the election. While any Russian attack on the U.S. seems like it would be a reckless escalation, Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who leads the House Intelligence Committee, noted that Mr. Putin’s decision-making so far has proved poor.', '“There’s a risk that whatever cybertools Russia uses in Ukraine don’t stay in Ukraine,” he said in an interview last week. “We’ve seen this before, where malware directed to a certain target gets released in the wild and then takes on a life of its own.

He was 71.', 'His wife, Marcia Bush, said his death, at Stanford Hospital, was caused by heart failure.', 'In the spring of 1973, just after enrolling as a graduate student at Stanford University, Mr. Boggs began an internship at Xerox PARC, a Silicon Valley research lab that was developing a new kind of personal computer. One afternoon, in the basement of the lab, he noticed another researcher tinkering with a long strand of cable.', 'The researcher, another new hire named Bob Metcalfe, was exploring ways of sending information to and from the lab’s new computer, the Alto. Mr. Metcalfe was trying to send electrical pulses down the cable, and he was struggling to make it work. So Mr. Boggs offered to help.', 'Over the next two years, they designed the first version of Ethernet.', '“He was the perfect partner for me,” Mr. Metcalfe said in an interview. “I was more of a concept artist, and he was a build-the-hardware-in-the-back-room engineer.”', 'Many of the key technologies that would be developed over the next two decades as part of the Alto project would come to define the modern computer, including the mouse, the graphical user interface, the word processor and the laser printer, as well as Ethernet.', 'Ethernet was not the first networking technology. Most notably, researchers at various universities and companies were already running a computer network called Arpanet, which would evolve into today’s internet. But Ethernet was something different — a way of connecting devices in proximity, not over long distances.', 'Other universities and companies built similar technologies. But in the 1980s and ’90s, after Ethernet was codified into an industry standard, it became the dominant protocol for building networks in corporate offices. It would eventually be used in homes too, if in smaller ways. Today’s wireless networks borrow pieces from the Ethernet protocol and often connect to Ethernet hardware.', '“Whatever you are reading this on — if you are not reading it on paper — you are probably using Ethernet,” Marc Weber, curator and director of the Internet History Program at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., said in an interview.', 'David Reeves Boggs was born on June 17, 1950, in Washington, D.C., and spent parts of his early childhood in Kentucky, Kansas and other places across the country. His father, James Boggs, was a finance officer in the U.S. Army whose job required him to move with his family to a new post every few years.', 'After his parents divorced, David Boggs grew up in Washington with his mother, Jane (McCallum) Boggs, and his older brother, Walter. The three of them lived in his grandmother’s house, near American University, where his mother went to work as an administrator, eventually overseeing admissions for the university’s law school.', 'After saving up for a radio operator’s license, David began building ham radios, spending his nights chatting with other operators across the country. His brother remembered the two of them stringing antennas from a second-floor bedroom to the roof over the garage.', '“Back then, those wires seemed so long,” said Walter Boggs, who still lives in the house. “Now it looks like a very short distance.”', 'David Boggs earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at Princeton University before starting at Stanford, where he eventually received both a master’s and a Ph.D., also in electrical engineering. Early in his Stanford career, he saw a presentation from Alan Kay, one of the key thinkers at PARC. He introduced himself to Mr. Kay, which led to an internship at the lab and later a full-time research position.', 'At PARC, as Mr. Metcalfe and Mr. Boggs pieced together a blueprint for Ethernet technology, borrowing ideas from a wireless network at the University of Hawaii called ALOHAnet. This work dovetailed with one of Mr. Boggs’s oldest interests: radio.', 'Sending tiny packets of information between computers and other devices, including printers, Ethernet could potentially work both with wires and without. In the 1980s, it became the standard protocol for wireline PC networks. In the late ’90s, it served as the basis for Wi-Fi, which would pervade homes and offices over the next two decades.', 'However it was used, the power of Ethernet was that it assumed things would go wrong. Even if some packets were lost — as they inevitably would be — the network could keep going.', 'In 1979, Mr. Metcalfe founded a company, 3Com, that commercialized Ethernet, while Mr. Boggs chose to remain at PARC as a researcher. Later, he moved to another research lab at DEC, one of the computing giants of the 1970s and ’80s, before starting his own Ethernet company, LAN Media, which was later sold to a larger player called SBE.', 'Mr. Boggs’s wife and brother are his only immediate survivors.', 'Before becoming the dominant networking protocol, Ethernet was challenged by several other technologies. In the early 1980s, Mr. Metcalfe said, when Mr. Boggs took the stage at a California computing conference, at the San Jose Convention Center, to discuss the future of networking, a rival technologist questioned the mathematical theory behind Ethernet, telling Mr. Boggs that it would never work with large numbers of machines.', 'His response was unequivocal. “Seems Ethernet does not work in theory,” he said, “only in practice.”']","['Boggs', 'computer', 'Metcalfe', 'technology', 'network', 'lab', 'David', 'ethernet', 'Stanford', 'company', 'researcher', 'University', 'protocol', 'networking', 'way', 'university', 'radio', 'research', 'PARC', '’']",images/114.png

Then Google and Meta, which owns Facebook, barred Russian state-run media from selling ads on their platforms. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, also spoke with top European Union officials over how to counter Russian disinformation.', 'At the same time, Telegram, a widely used messaging app in Russia and Ukraine, threatened to shut down channels related to the war because of rampant misinformation. And this week, Twitter said it would label all posts containing links to Russian state-affiliated media outlets, and Meta and YouTube said they would restrict access to some of those outlets across the European Union to ward off war propaganda.', 'For many of the companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, the war is an opportunity to rehabilitate their reputations after facing questions in recent years over privacy, market dominance and how they spread toxic and divisive content. They have a chance to show they can use their technology for good in a way not seen since the Arab Spring in 2011, when social media connected activists and was cheered as an instrument for democracy.', 'But the tech companies face tricky decisions. Any missteps could be costly, adding more momentum to efforts in Europe and the United States to regulate their businesses or leading Russia to ban them altogether.', 'Executives inside the companies are making judgment calls about what to do, employees said. If Google, Meta, Twitter and others take some steps and not others, they might be accused of doing too little and looking halfhearted. But curbing too many services and information might also cut off ordinary Russians from the digital conversations that can counteract state-run propaganda.', '“These companies want all the benefits of monopolizing the world’s communications with none of the responsibility of getting swept up in geopolitics and having to choose sides,” said Yael Eisenstat, a fellow at the Berggruen Institute, a Los Angeles think tank, who formerly led Facebook’s election integrity operations. In many ways, she said, tech companies are “in a no-win situation in the midst of an international crisis.”', 'Many of the companies have moved gingerly, said Marietje Schaake, a tech policy expert and former member of the European Parliament. While Google and Meta blocked Russian state media from selling ads on their sites last week, the companies did not bar the outlets, as many Western policymakers had urged.', 'As the conflict has ratcheted up, the companies have taken additional steps. On Sunday, Google’s Maps division stopped displaying traffic information inside Ukraine out of concerns that it could create safety risks by showing where people were gathering. Facebook announced that it had taken down a pro-Kremlin influence campaign and a separate hacking campaign targeting its users in Ukraine.', 'On Monday, Twitter began labeling all tweets containing links to Russian state-affiliated media outlets so users would be aware of the information sources. Since the conflict in Ukraine began, users have tweeted links to state-affiliated media about 45,000 times a day, the company said.', 'Ms. Schaake, now the international policy director at Stanford University’s Cyber Policy Center, said the measures were not enough. She said the companies must block Russian propaganda outlets and establish clearer policies about their beliefs in human rights and democracy that could be applied beyond Russia.', '“The interventions under huge pressure also underline what has not been done for so long,” she said.', 'Others warned that there would be negative consequences if the platforms were blocked in Russia. “It’s the most important place for public debate about what’s going on,” said Andrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist and censorship expert. “Nobody would take it as a good sign if Facebook blocked access for Russian citizens.”', ' Google said it continues to monitor the situation in Ukraine and Twitter said it took its role in the conflict seriously. Facebook declined to comment.', 'Telegram’s experience illustrates the competing pressures. The app is popular in Russia and Ukraine for sharing images, videos and information about the war. But it has also become a gathering ground for war misinformation, such as unverified images from battlefields.', 'On Sunday, Pavel Durov, Telegram’s founder, posted to his more than 600,000 followers on the platform that he was considering blocking some war-related channels inside Ukraine and Russia because they could aggravate the conflict and incite ethnic hatred.', 'Users responded with alarm, saying they relied on Telegram for independent information. Less than an hour later, Mr. Durov reversed course.', 'Russian forces appear stalled. With Russia’s advance on Ukraine’s major cities stalled and satellite imagery showing soldiers digging into defensive positions around Kyiv, a consensus is emerging in the West that the war has reached a bloody stalemate.', 'Mariupol is still suffering. Russian forces continued to bombard the besieged coastal city, hitting a\xa0drama school\xa0where 400 people were hiding, according to local officials. The city’s mayor said thousands of residents had been forcibly deported to Russia.', 'A Ukrainian base is hit. A missile attack on barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv killed more than 40 marines, a Ukrainian official said. That would make it one of the single deadliest attacks on Ukrainian forces since the start of the war, and the death toll could be much higher.', 'Putin does not want direct negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly called for direct negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the hope of ending the war, but Mr. Putin does not think the time is right for talks, according to a senior Turkish official.', '“Many users asked us not to consider disabling Telegram channels for the period of the conflict, since we are the only source of information for them,” he wrote. Telegram did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Inside Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, the situation has been “chaotic” because of the volume of Russian disinformation on its apps, said two employees, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Russian experts on Meta’s security team, which identifies and removes state-sponsored disinformation from Facebook and Instagram, have been working around the clock and communicating regularly with Twitter, YouTube and other companies about their findings, the two employees said.', 'Meta’s security team has long debated whether to restrict Sputnik and Russia Today, two of Russia’s largest state-run media sites, on its platforms or label their posts so they clearly state their source. Russia Today and Sputnik are “critical elements in Russia’s disinformation and propaganda ecosystem,” according to a January report from the State Department.', 'Meta executives had resisted the moves, saying they would anger Russia, the employees said. But after war broke out, Nick Clegg, who heads global affairs for Meta, announced on Monday that the company would restrict access to Russia Today and Sputnik across the European Union.', 'Tech companies now face two main types of war-related demands from governments.', 'Russia is pressuring them to increasingly censor social media posts and other information flows inside the country. Moscow has already heavily restricted access to Facebook and Twitter, with YouTube potentially next. On Monday, Russia demanded that Google block ads carried on its platform related to the war. That followed an order on Sunday to lift restrictions on pro-Kremlin media outlets related to Ukraine, without saying how it would enforce the order.', 'At the same time, Western officials are pushing the companies to block Russian state media and propaganda.

She blithely added, “You can also begin shopping by scanning the QR code in your Amazon app.”', '“Let’s go for the palm,” I said.', 'In less than a minute, I scanned both hands on a kiosk and linked them to my Amazon account. Then I hovered my right palm over the turnstile reader to enter the nation’s most technologically sophisticated grocery store.', 'For the next 30 minutes, I shopped. I picked up a bag of cauliflower florets, grapefruit sparkling water, a carton of strawberries and a package of organic chicken sausages. Cameras and sensors recorded each of my moves, creating a virtual shopping cart for me in real time. Then I simply walked out, no cashier necessary. Whole Foods — or rather Amazon — would bill my account later.', 'More than four years ago, Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13 billion. Now the Amazon-ification of the grocery chain is physically complete, as showcased by the revamped Whole Foods store in Glover Park.', 'For a long time, Amazon made only small steps toward putting its mark on the more than 500 Whole Foods stores in the United States and Britain. The main evidence of change were the discounts and free home delivery for Amazon Prime members.', 'But this 21,000-square-foot Whole Foods just north of Georgetown has catapulted Amazon’s involvement forward. Along with another prototype Whole Foods store, which will open in Los Angeles this year, Amazon designed my local grocer to be almost completely run by tracking and robotic tools for the first time.', 'The technology, known as Just Walk Out, consists of hundreds of cameras with a god’s-eye view of customers. Sensors are placed under each apple, carton of oatmeal and boule of multigrain bread. Behind the scenes, deep-learning software analyzes the shopping activity to detect patterns and increase the accuracy of its charges.', 'The technology is comparable to what’s in driverless cars. It identifies when we lift a product from a shelf, freezer or produce bin; automatically itemizes the goods; and charges us when we leave the store. Anyone with an Amazon account, not just Prime members, can shop this way and skip a cash register since the bill shows up in our Amazon account.', 'Amazon has tested such automation for more than four years, starting with 24 Amazon Go convenience stores and several Amazon Fresh grocery stores around the country. The palm-scanning technology, known as Amazon One, is also being licensed by others, such as a Hudson convenience store at Dallas Love Field Airport and Shaquille O’Neal’s Big Chicken restaurant at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle.', 'Those stores were valuable experiments, said Dilip Kumar, Amazon’s vice president of physical retail and technology. The company is treating Whole Foods as another step in its tech expansion into retail stores, he said.', '“We observed areas that caused friction for customers, and we diligently worked backward to figure out ways to alleviate that friction,” Mr. Kumar said. “We’ve always noticed that customers didn’t like standing in checkout lines. It’s not the most productive use of their time, which is how we came up with the idea to build Just Walk Out.”', 'He declined to comment on whether Amazon planned to expand the technology to all Whole Foods stores.', 'My New York Times colleague Karen Weise, who covers Amazon from Seattle, said the company operated on long time horizons, with the patience and money to execute slowly. That has allowed it to transform labor, retail and logistics over many years, she said. Groceries are just one piece of its ambitions.', 'The Whole Foods in Glover Park has operated for more than 20 years, a cornerstone of a neighborhood that is within walking distance of Embassy Row and the vice president’s Naval Observatory residence. Four years ago, the store closed over a dispute with the landlord and a rat infestation. Amazon announced last year that it would reopen the store as a Just Walk Out pilot project.', 'The rats may be gone, but not the neighborhood angst. The renovated store has sparked a spirited local debate, with residents sparring on the Nextdoor community app and a neighborhood email list over the store’s “dystopian” feeling versus its “impressive technology.” Some neighbors reminisced about how the store used to invite people to just hang out, with free samples and fluffy blueberry pancakes sold on weekends.', 'Alex Levin, 55, an 18-year resident of Glover Park, said people should not reject the store’s changes.', '“We need to understand the benefits and downsides of the technology and use it to our advantage,” he said. He added that he had tried tricking the cameras and sensors by placing a box of chicken nuggets in his shopping bag and then putting the item back in a freezer. Amazon wasn’t fooled, and he wasn’t charged for the nuggets, he said.', 'But others said they had found errors in their bills and complained about the end of produce by the pound. Everything is now offered per item, bundle or box. Some mourned the disappearance of the checkout line, where they perused magazines and last-minute grab bag items. Many were suspicious of the tracking tech.', '“It’s like George Orwell’s ‘1984,’” said Allen Hengst, 72, a retired librarian.', 'Amazon said it didn’t plan to use video and other Whole Foods customer information for advertising or its recommendation engine. Shoppers who don’t want to participate in the experimental technology can enter the store without signing in and pay at self-checkout kiosks with a credit card or cash.', 'As a longtime customer of Glover Park’s Whole Foods, I had missed the dark, cramped and often chaotic store and was excited to explore the changes. But somewhere between the palm scan and the six-pack banana bundles, I began to feel ambivalent.', 'I noticed a sign near the entrance that forbade shoppers to take photos or videos inside. My eyes drifted toward the ceiling, where I noticed hundreds of small black plastic boxes hanging from the rafters.', 'An employee jumped in. “Those are the cameras that will follow you during your shopping experience,” she explained, with no hint of irony.', 'Several workers milled about the entrance to guide customers through check-in, while others stood behind the seafood counter, cheese station and produce areas. Mr. Kumar said the stores would always employ humans, but I wondered for how much longer. Amazon, under scrutiny for its labor practices, said employees’ roles might shift over time and become more focused on interacting with customers to answer questions.', 'There were early signs of a more self-service future. At the bakery, I looked for someone to slice my $4.99 Harvest loaf and was directed to an industry-grade bread slicer for customers. A small label warned: Sharp blades. Keep hands clear of all moving parts.', 'Mr. Kumar wouldn’t share data on the accuracy of Just Walk Out, so I tested the technology. I picked up an organic avocado and placed it on a pile of nonorganic avocados. After walking around the store, I went back and picked up the same organic avocado. If the cameras and sensors functioned properly, Amazon would be on top of my actions and charge me for the organic avocado that had been misplaced in the conventional bin.', 'When I was ready to leave, I had the option of using a self-checkout kiosk or skipping the process. I decided on the latter and waved my palm again over an exit turnstile. The turnstile’s arms opened.', '“You should receive your receipt within two to three hours,” an employee at the exit said.', 'I walked out. It felt discomfiting, like I might be mistaken for a shoplifter.', 'An email from Amazon landed in my inbox an hour later. A link sent me to my Amazon account for details. It said my shopping experience had lasted 32 minutes 26 seconds. My total bill was $34.35 — and I was correctly charged for the organic avocado.']","['Amazon', 'store', 'Foods', 'technology', 'customer', 'year', 'time', 'Park', 'Glover', 'account', 'camera', 'shopping', 'avocado', 'palm', 'grocery', 'neighborhood', 'checkout', 'minute', 'sensor', 'employee']",images/116.png

The so-called landing law makes the companies and their employees more vulnerable to Russia’s legal system and the demands of government censors, legal experts and civil society groups said.', 'The moves are part of a Russian pressure campaign against foreign technology companies. Using the prospect of fines, arrests and the blocking or slowing down of internet services, the authorities are pushing the companies to censor unfavorable material online while keeping pro-Kremlin media unfiltered.', 'Apple, TikTok and Spotify have complied with the landing law, according to the Russian internet regulator, Roskomnadzor, and Google has taken steps to do so as well. Twitch and Telegram have not. Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Twitter have complied with some parts of the law but not others.', 'The situation puts the tech companies in a bind, caught between their public support for free expression and privacy and their work in countries with authoritarian leaders. It has forced them to weigh having their services available in Russia against leaving altogether.', 'Increasingly, the companies are facing pressure from Ukrainian officials and U.S. lawmakers to limit their involvement in Russia. Ukraine’s vice prime minister has asked Apple, Google, Netflix and Meta to restrict access to their services inside Russia. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Meta, Reddit, Telegram and others, urging them to not let Russian entities use their platforms to sow confusion about the war.', 'The companies are facing contradictory demands from all over the globe. Censorship issues that were once isolated to China, which is home to perhaps the world’s most restrictive internet, have spread to Russia, Turkey, Belarus, Myanmar and elsewhere as some of them try to build a more tightly controlled web.', 'For Russia, censoring the internet isn’t easy. While China has built a series of filters known as the Great Firewall around its internet, Russia’s internet is more open, and U.S. tech platforms are widely used in the country. To change that, the Russian government has built new technical methods for blocking content, which it used last year to throttle access to Twitter.', 'Now Russia is expected to ramp up pressure on the tech companies as the authorities try to control what information is disseminated about the war in Ukraine. Russians have used Facebook, Instagram and other foreign social media outlets to criticize the conflict, stoking concerns of a crackdown on the platforms.', 'On Friday, Roskomnadzor said it would restrict access to Facebook by slowing down traffic.

The company said it would bar Russian state media from running ads on the social network.', 'Twitter, which had said it was pausing ads in Ukraine and Russia, said on Saturday that its service was also being restricted for some people in Russia. On Sunday, Roskomnadzor also demanded that Google lift restrictions on some Russian media outlets after the company had limited their ability to make money from advertising on YouTube.', 'The clampdown “is an attempt by the Russian government to increase control over these companies and the content online in Russia,” said Pavel Chikov, a human rights lawyer in Russia who specializes in censorship cases. “The Russian government will be pushing them, step by step, to go further down this road.”', 'Western companies and organizations are just beginning to sort out their ties to Russia in light of sanctions intended to economically isolate the country. Energy companies are grappling with the possibility of reduced supplies of oil and natural gas. Food producers are facing a potential shortfall of Russian and Ukrainian wheat. Even European soccer clubs have dropped sponsorships from Russian companies, with a major championship match moving from St. Petersburg to Paris.', 'The situation is especially fraught for tech companies. Apple and Google control the software on almost every smartphone in Russia and have employees there. YouTube, Instagram and TikTok are popular sites that are used to get information outside state-run media. Telegram, the messaging app that started in Russia and is now based in Dubai after disputes with the government, is one of the country’s more popular communication tools.', 'The new landing law is a move by the Kremlin to counter attempts by the tech companies to minimize their physical presences in Russia. The law, which took effect on Jan. 1, requires foreign websites and social media platforms that have over 500,000 daily users to register as legal entities in the country, with a locally based leader. It also requires the companies to register an account with Roskomnadzor and to create an electronic form for Russian citizens or government authorities to contact the companies with complaints.', 'Establishing more of a local presence makes the companies vulnerable to intimidation by the government, human rights and civil society groups have warned, leading some to call it the “hostage law.” Last year, the Russian authorities threatened to arrest employees of Google and Apple to force them to remove an app created by supporters of Aleksei A. Navalny, the imprisoned Russian opposition leader.', '“The Russian government would like to have embassies of those companies in Russia,” said Aleksandr Litreev, who worked with Mr. Navalny and is the chief executive of Solar Labs, a maker of software to circumvent online censorship. “They would like to have a way to pull a lever to manipulate information and how it is spreading around the internet.”', 'In November, the government listed 13 companies that must comply with the new landing law: Meta, Twitter, TikTok, Likeme, Pinterest, Viber, Telegram, Discord, Zoom, Apple, Google, Spotify and Twitch.', 'Russian forces appear stalled.

S. Customs and Border Protection agency (C.B.P.) on their return home in the form of biometric facial recognition. Following a directive by Congress’s 9/11 Commission to increase border security by using biometrics, C.B.P. began ramping up the technology in 2018 in a program called Simplified Arrival. Among other biometric measurements available, including iris scans and fingerprints, the agency selected facial recognition, which uses a computer algorithm to compare a picture taken in person at airport immigration or another border checkpoint to the traveler’s passport picture or visa.', '“We’ve automated a manual process,” said Diane Sabatino, the deputy executive assistant commissioner for C.B.P., who is overseeing the biometric program.', 'Some privacy advocates have questioned the use of the technology. Addressing equity, Senators Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, and Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, sent a letter to the agency in January requesting more information “to ensure that flagged individuals are treated in a safe, fair and noninvasive manner given the imperfection of facial recognition software.”', 'The following are excerpts from an interview on the issues with Ms. Sabatino, edited for length and clarity.', 'When we looked at different biometric technology — fingerprints, iris and facial scans — we landed with facial because it is such a simple process. Travelers present themselves and their documentation and pose for a quick photo in seconds. The officer has the data they need based on a discussion with the traveler about the purpose of the trip and ultimately can make a decision about whether further examination is needed. We can now leverage technology that’s better at making comparisons. The officer is still the ultimate decision maker. Travelers can opt out.', 'It’s a streamlined process. One benefit is helping officers be more efficient at determining the intent of travel. It’s also better at identifying potential impostors. And the third piece we hadn’t contemplated was the added health benefits. We have a security enhancement at a time and place where individuals are already expected to present themselves for identity verification, and now we’re adding touchless travel and limiting the spread of pathogens. It wasn’t something we were contemplating when we developed it, but it certainly made sense.', 'Manual verification lasts 10 to 30 seconds, depending on environmental factors. Someone outside at a land border could be more challenged because of the lighting. As we automate and refine facial recognition technology, we’re taking two to three seconds to verify the match. The match is one tool in the entire process. That tool doesn’t make the decision to admit or require further examination. It is the officer and the totality of the circumstances. The priority is security.', 'Since deployment, in about the first three years, primarily in the air passenger environment and somewhat in maritime, we have identified about 300 impostors using the technology. That doesn’t mean we would not have otherwise identified them. In the last year, at pedestrian land crossings at the southern land border, it caught about 1,000 to 1,100.', 'Our business use case is in identifying individuals at a time and place where they would normally expect to present themselves for identity verification. We are not grabbing images and scraping social media. Individuals are presenting a passport and we have a repository to tap into and build galleries in advance of their arrival using U.S. passport photos and photos of those who have applied for visas. So we build these galleries in the airport and maritime environments based on information already provided for identity verification. We match it to the information we have.', 'And we’re making sure there’s secure encryption. When a gallery is created, that photo isn’t attached to any information and can’t be reverse engineered to be compromised. The design is based on the privacy measures we knew had to be in place. Images for U.S. citizens are retained less than 12 hours and often times much less.', 'That’s certainly something we’re very tuned into. We have partnered with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to provide information on the program. Our high-performing algorithms show virtually no demonstrable difference when it comes to demographics.', 'We post signage at all ports of entry. Individuals opting out need to notify the officer at inspection. It would then revert to the manual process.', 'We have it rolled out in pedestrian lanes at land borders. In the air environment, we’re covering about 99 percent with Simplified Arrival. The land border is the final frontier. We just completed a 120-day pilot in the car lanes at Hidalgo, Texas, and we’ll be evaluating the outcome. At cruise terminals, we’re in the 90 percent range. We’re working with nine major carriers at eight ports of entry, including Miami, Port Canaveral and Port Everglades, all in Florida.', 'We welcome the scrutiny from privacy advocacy groups. We want to be able to tell and share the story about the investment we’ve made with respect to privacy. There are so many myths and so much misinformation out there, conflating what we do with surveillance. Anytime new technology is rolled out, there are always legitimate concerns. We welcome those questions. They help us answer better when we are building out these systems.', 'Elaine Glusac writes the Frugal Traveler column.

Six days before the military campaign began, Russia announced a yearslong deal to sell 100 million tons of coal to China — a contract worth more than $20 billion. And hours before Russia began bombing Ukraine, China agreed to buy Russian wheat despite concerns about plant diseases.', 'In a throwback to the 1950s, when Mao Zedong worked closely with Joseph Stalin and then Nikita Khrushchev, China is again drawing close to Russia. As the United States and the European Union have become wary of China, Beijing’s leaders have decided that their best geopolitical prospects lie in marrying their vast industrial might with Russia’s formidable natural resources.', 'Recent food and energy deals are just the latest signals of China’s economic alignment with Russia.', '“What happened up to now is only a beginning for both the Russian expansionism by force and the Chinese economic and financial support to Russia,” Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said in a text message. “This does not mean that China directly supports in any degree that expansionism — this only means that Beijing strongly feels the necessity to maintain and boost strategic partnership with Moscow.”', 'The United States and the European Union are hoping that sanctions force Russia to reconsider its policies. But Wang Wenbin, the Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesman, said at a briefing on Friday that China opposed the use of sanctions.', '“Sanctions are never an effective way to solve the problems,” he said. “I hope relevant parties will still try to solve the problem through dialogue and consultation.”', 'At the same time, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has imposed an awkward diplomatic quandary on China by violating the principle of national sovereignty that the Chinese leaders regard as sacrosanct. While President Xi Jinping of China has not criticized Russia publicly, he could use his country’s economic relationship with its northern neighbor as leverage to persuade the Russians to resolve the crisis quickly.', 'Mr. Xi and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia spoke by phone on Friday. An official Chinese statement said afterward that Mr. Xi had expressed support for Russia in negotiating an agreement with Ukraine — a stance that Mr. Putin has also favored, provided that Ukraine accepts his terms.', 'Until now, much of China’s energy and food imports came across seas patrolled by the U.S. or Indian navies. As China’s leaders have focused lately on the possibility of conflict, with military spending last year growing four times as fast as other government spending, they have emphasized greater reliance on Russia for crucial supplies.', 'China and Russia share a nearly 2,700-mile border, and in recent years China has become Russia’s largest source of imports and the biggest destination for its exports.', '“Given the geopolitical tensions, Russia is a very natural geopolitical partner,” said Andy Mok, a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.', 'Initial Western sanctions on Russia have focused on limiting technology exports and imposing financial penalties. For now, U.S. officials have avoided targeting consumer goods, agricultural products and energy, to try to avoid harming ordinary people and further fueling inflation.', 'China is the world’s dominant manufacturer of electronics, machinery and other manufactured goods, and has been supplying them to Russia in exchange for food and energy.', 'A new cornerstone of relations between China and Russia is a statement that some Western officials say is effectively a Sino-Russian nonaggression pact. It was released by Beijing and Moscow on Feb. 4, when Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin met before the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The statement said the countries’ friendship “has no bounds.”', 'The two nations have been growing their ties for years, and the strength of the bond appeared to give Mr. Putin the confidence to move troops and military equipment from Russia’s border with China and other parts of Siberia earlier this winter to Russia’s border with Ukraine and Belarus. The more robust relationship is also ushering in closer economic cooperation.', '“The joint statement is strong and has lasting consequences for the new world order,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a research professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University.', 'The Chinese and Russian governments share many values, particularly their antipathy to sanctions the West imposes on human-rights grounds. “The two sides firmly believe that defending democracy and human rights should not be used as a tool to exert pressure on other countries,” their pact on Feb. 4 said.', 'When the Obama administration imposed sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, China helped Russia evade them.', 'But it is not clear if China will help Russia evade sanctions put in place this week. On Tuesday, the Biden administration added to previous measures by announcing sanctions against Russia’s two largest financial institutions and sweeping restrictions on advanced technologies that can be exported to Russia. The technological curbs, when taken in concert with allies, would block roughly a fifth of Russian imports, the administration said.', 'Chinese companies that circumvent those rules could face escalating punishment by the United States, including criminal and civil penalties, said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Those businesses could also be cut off from American technology and the financial system.', 'ZTE and Huawei, two Chinese firms that were barred from receiving American technological exports, attracted the attention of the U.S. government in part for evading sanctions on Iran.', '“The interesting question is: Is China going to comply with this?” Mr. Chorzempa said. China also has a law designed to penalize companies for following extraterritorial sanctions by countries like the United States, he said, all factors that “could put companies in a real bind.”', '“If they don’t comply with the U.S., they’re in trouble with the U.S., but if they don’t comply with China, they could also face penalties in China,” he said.', 'Of course, collecting fines from companies that are unwilling to pay and monitoring whether businesses comply with the rules could be difficult, Mr. Chorzempa added. “It’s already proving difficult to monitor the things that are already controlled, and if you expand that list, that’s going to be a real challenge to verify what’s going to Russia,” he said.', 'Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes\xa0and spooking investors. The conflict has already caused\u200b\u200b dizzying spikes in energy prices,\xa0and could severely affect various countries and industries.', 'The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion. \xa0Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.', 'Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.', 'Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat;\xa0together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.', 'Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.', 'Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions\xa0intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.', 'The Biden administration’s export controls apply to goods produced in any country as long as they use U.S. technology — including chip makers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and the Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry Corporation.', 'Both of those companies continue to rely on the United States for certain components and manufacturing technology, said Gabriel Wildau, a managing director at Teneo, a consulting firm. If they continue supplying to Russia, SMIC and other Chinese companies could be cut off from U.S. technology, the same kind of penalty that crippled Huawei. On Friday, Taiwan Semiconductor said it was committed to complying with the export controls.', '“If Beijing is viewed as Moscow’s enabler, pressure will rise in the U.S. Congress to extend these restrictions,” Mr. Wildau wrote in a note to clients. Beijing would also face the risk that other major technology exporters, like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands, “would adopt Washington’s tougher line,” he said.', 'China’s state-owned banks could also face risks for continuing to lend to Russia. China and Russia have been settling more of their trade using the renminbi and the ruble. Beijing has also been trying to develop the digital use of its currency as an alternative to the dollar, which could help Russia limit the effect of financial sanctions.', 'But Chinese banks are still deeply reliant on the U.S. dollar. While major Chinese banks already appeared to be pulling back their financing for Russia, Mr. Wildau said, Beijing could choose to support Russia using smaller state-owned banks that don’t do a lot of international business that requires the use of the dollar.', 'China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela and other countries have all felt the brunt of American financial sanctions, highlighting their need for more trade and investment in currencies other than the dollar, Mr. Mok said.', 'Even if Chinese entities circumvent U.S. rules, Beijing is unlikely to publicize it. Despite its professed distaste for sanctions, China regularly punishes trading partners that have offended it in some way. But it does this through unannounced orders sent to customs officials, to avoid clear violations of international trade rules.', 'China currently has an unannounced trade embargo against Lithuania, after Lithuania agreed to let Taiwan open an office there. Russia also has frosty relations with Lithuania, a former Soviet republic that has embraced democracy and joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.', 'China quietly halted purchases of barley, coal, wine and several other commodities from Australia for more than a year, and stopped exports of crucial rare earth metals to Japan for two months in 2010 over a territorial dispute.', 'China’s embrace of Russia on energy, food and financial issues carries risks for Beijing and for Mr. Xi.', 'China is running huge and rapidly rising trade surpluses with the United States and European nations. If China is perceived to be enabling Mr. Putin’s aggressive moves, that could strengthen support in the West for tariffs or other curbs on technology and trade.', 'Further trade barriers might start to wean Western companies and consumers from their reliance on Chinese factories, which have created tens of millions of jobs in China.', 'Anticipating such a threat, Mr. Xi has worked hard over the last several years to reduce China’s reliance on other countries by subsidizing companies to make a nearly complete range of industrial goods domestically.', 'In a speech in 2020, he ordered that China “tighten the dependence of the international industrial chain on our country, so as to develop a strong countermeasure and deterrent ability against external attempts to sever our supply chains.”', 'Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing, and Ana Swanson from Washington.

And even when price comparison is easier and more prevalent, such as for airline tickets or hotel reservations, consumers get an incomplete picture of the actual cost because of add-on fees.', '“We’re flooded with so many prices, an inundation of numbers, that it’s hard for any specific numbers to really stick,” said Nick Kolenda, an author and a creator of YouTube videos about consumer psychology and tricks played by marketers to induce shoppers.', 'The prices of some goods, like gasoline, a cup of coffee or a gallon of milk, are easier to remember because people buy them regularly and in person. When shopping happens online, the picture can become hazy — although the experience may not be universal, especially for people living on limited means.', '“Losing track of prices has a lot to do with how sensitive a given household budget is,” said Chi-En Yu, who runs Goodbudget, a budget tracking app. “If your household is quite sensitive to the prices of consumer goods, then on some level you don’t have the luxury of losing sight of prices.”', 'It may also indicate that wealthier consumers tend to shop more online. Unlike physical stores, where changing prices can be laborious, the internet provides the perfect sandbox for experiments on exactly what consumers are willing to pay.', 'In 2000, Amazon sparked outrage when it was found to be charging different prices for the same DVDs only moments apart.

Some third-party sellers, who pay Amazon a fee to list products on its website, were charging exorbitant prices. So Ms. Hoffmann bought a different box of Pokemon cards from Target on Black Friday.', 'Dynamic pricing — when prices move in accordance with market conditions — is just one reason people lose touch with what things cost.', 'Discounts tied to loyalty programs or annual subscriptions like Amazon Prime and Walmart+ also complicate the math. At the same time, features meant to save time and enhance convenience, such as automated monthly deliveries of household goods, have made shoppers less price aware.', '“The general playbook for the post-2000s with retail is that everything is about obfuscating prices,” said Jason Murray, who worked at Amazon for 20 years and is now chief executive of Shipium, an e-commerce start-up. “This is the game that companies are playing by removing the reference points so people think they’re getting a good price.”', 'Retailers and brands are bombarding shoppers with discounts, one-time offers and different gimmicks that overwhelm them with numbers while giving the impression that they are getting a good deal. And even when price comparison is easier and more prevalent, such as for airline tickets or hotel reservations, consumers get an incomplete picture of the actual cost because of add-on fees.', '“We’re flooded with so many prices, an inundation of numbers, that it’s hard for any specific numbers to really stick,” said Nick Kolenda, an author and a creator of YouTube videos about consumer psychology and tricks played by marketers to induce shoppers.', 'The prices of some goods, like gasoline, a cup of coffee or a gallon of milk, are easier to remember because people buy them regularly and in person. When shopping happens online, the picture can become hazy — although the experience may not be universal, especially for people living on limited means.', '“Losing track of prices has a lot to do with how sensitive a given household budget is,” said Chi-En Yu, who runs Goodbudget, a budget tracking app. “If your household is quite sensitive to the prices of consumer goods, then on some level you don’t have the luxury of losing sight of prices.”', 'It may also indicate that wealthier consumers tend to shop more online. Unlike physical stores, where changing prices can be laborious, the internet provides the perfect sandbox for experiments on exactly what consumers are willing to pay.', 'In 2000, Amazon sparked outrage when it was found to be charging different prices for the same DVDs only moments apart. (Amazon charged one customer $65 for a “Planet of the Apes” DVD and another shopper $75.) Jeff Bezos, then Amazon’s chief executive, apologized for creating buyer uncertainty with a “random price test.”', 'While Amazon said it did not practice discriminatory pricing — charging different people different prices based on demographics — it is all in on dynamic pricing. Profitero, an e-commerce analytics firm, estimated in 2013 that Amazon tweaked prices 2.5 million times a day. (It is safe to assume that the number has grown.)', 'The result is that prices for household goods swing back and forth and, at times, are subject to price surges more commonly found in ride-hailing services.', '“The problem today is that you don’t have any idea whether prices are going up or down. It’s like the stock market,” said Venky Harinarayan, a partner at Rocketship.vc, a venture capital firm. He was an early employee at Amazon and helped Walmart with its pricing technology.', 'Even paper towels are subject to Bitcoin-like volatility. A year ago, a 12-roll pack of Bounty paper towels was selling on Amazon for around $30, according to Camelcamelcamel. The price dropped to $23 in April and then jumped to $35 in October. This past week, it settled around $28.', 'For the deal-hungry shopper, the time saved shopping online and avoiding stores has been replaced by time spent scouring the internet for a bargain.', 'The transition to a cashless economy has also dulled the psychological pain of paying, said Ravi Dhar, a behavioral scientist and professor at the Yale School of Management. Digital payments and credit cards make transactions so devoid of friction that people lose awareness of their spending.', 'According to a 2009 research paper by Amy Finkelstein, an economics professor at M.I.T., when people use cash less, prices go up. Dr. Finkelstein studied what happened when states introduced electronic toll collection. After enough drivers installed the toll readers in their cars, she estimated, tolls became up to 40 percent more expensive than they would have been if only cash were accepted.', 'As part of her research, Dr. Finkelstein said, she asked drivers at a rest stop on the Massachusetts Turnpike how much they paid at the tollbooths that they had just passed. She found that 85 percent of people who had paid electronically got the price wrong, compared with only 31 percent of people who had paid cash.', '“The people paying electronically had no idea what they were paying,” Dr. Finkelstein said.', 'Even for price-conscious shoppers, it’s getting challenging to keep tabs.', '“Your average person isn’t going to know what’s the right price, what to spend, what to buy and when,” said Mike Stouber, 32, of Freehold, N.J. “It’s become so analytical and so much based on numbers that the normal person is not going to realize or pay attention.”', 'Mr. Stouber, a vice president at a communications firm, is no ordinary price-conscious shopper. He’s a ringer.', 'On “The Price Is Right” in 2019, he took home $262,743, the most money ever awarded to a daytime contestant. He made it to the show stage with the closest price estimate for a diamond tennis bracelet. Then, in a game called Plinko, he accurately guessed the prices for a hair dryer, a humidifier and a video game console to win more chances at cash prizes. (He failed to guess the correct price of a digital meat thermometer.)', 'These days, Mr. Stouber plays a different type of game with the fluctuating prices on Amazon. He ordered shower and sink fixtures for a bathroom renovation from Amazon in February last year. When he noticed a month later that the prices for the products were significantly cheaper, he contacted the company to see if it would refund the difference — something other stores do.', 'Amazon refused. So he returned the fixtures and bought them again at the lower price. Since he is an Amazon Prime customer, the shipping was free, and he saved $80.', '“Consumers want a deal, and companies want to figure out a way to get the most money out of you,” Mr. Stouber said. “It’s a game.

As Russia attacked Ukraine this week, those views spread, infusing the online discourse over the war with sympathy — and even approval — for the aggressor.', 'The positive Russia comments are an extension of the culture wars and grievance politics that have animated the right in the United States in the past few years. In some of these circles, Mr. Putin carries a strongman appeal, viewed as someone who gets his way and does not let political correctness stop him.', '“Putin embodies the strength that Trump pretended to have,” said Emerson T. Brooking, a resident senior fellow for the Atlantic Council who studies digital platforms. “For these individuals, Putin’s actions aren’t a tragedy — they’re a fantasy fulfilled.” ', 'Support for Mr. Putin and Russia is now being expressed online in a jumble of facts, observations and opinions, sometimes entwined with lies. In recent days, commenters have complimented Mr. Putin and falsely accused NATO of violating nonexistent territorial agreements with Russia, which they said justified the Russian president’s declaration of war on Ukraine, according to a review of posts by The New York Times.', 'Others have spread convoluted conspiracy theories about the war that are tinged with a pro-Russia sheen. In one popular lie circulating online, Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump are working together on the war. Another falsehood involves the idea that the war is about taking down a cabal of global elites over sex trafficking.', 'In all, pro-Russian narratives on English-language social media, cable TV, and print and online outlets soared 2,580 percent in the past week compared to the first week of February, according to an analysis by the media insights company Zignal Labs. Those mentions cropped up 5,740 times in the past week, up from 214 in the first week of February, Zignal said.', 'The narratives have flourished in dozens of Telegram channels, Facebook groups and pages and thousands of tweets, according to The Times’s review. Some of the Telegram channels have more than 160,000 subscribers, while the Facebook groups and pages have up to 1.9 million followers.', '(It is difficult to be precise on the scope of pro-Russian narratives on social media and online forums because bots and organized campaigns make them difficult to track.)', 'The pro-Russia sentiment is a stark departure from during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union was viewed by many Americans as a foe. In recent years, that attitude shifted, partly helped along by interference from Russia. Before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Kremlin-backed groups used social networks like Facebook to inflame American voters, creating more divisions and resistance to political correctness.', 'After Mr. Trump was elected, he often appeared favorable to — and even admiring of — Mr. Putin. That seeded a more positive view of Mr. Putin among Mr. Trump’s supporters, misinformation researchers said.', '“Putin has invested heavily in sowing discord” and found an ally in Mr. Trump, said Melissa Ryan, the chief executive of Card Strategies, a consulting firm that researches disinformation. “Anyone who studies disinformation or the far right has seen the influence of Putin’s investment take hold.”', 'At the same time, conspiracy theories spread online that deeply polarized Americans. One was the QAnon movement, which falsely posits that Democrats are Satan-worshiping child traffickers who are part of an elite cabal trying to control the world.', 'The Russia-Ukraine war is now being viewed by some Americans through the lens of conspiracy theories, misinformation researchers said. Roughly 41 million Americans believe in the QAnon conspiracy theory, according to a survey released on Thursday from the Public Religion Research Institute. This week, some QAnon followers said online that Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was simply the next phase in a global war against the sex traffickers.', 'Lisa Kaplan, the founder of Alethea Group, a company that helps fight online misinformation, said the pro-Russia statements were potentially harmful because it could “further legitimize false or misleading claims” about the Ukraine conflict “in the eyes of the American people.”', 'Not all online discourse is pro-Russia, and Mr. Putin’s actions have been condemned by conservative social media users, mainstream commentators and Republican politicians, even as some have criticized how Mr. Biden has handled the conflict.', '“Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is reckless and evil,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, said in a statement on Twitter on Thursday.', 'On Tuesday, Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois who was censured recently by the Republican Party for participating in the committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, criticized House Republicans for attacking Mr. Biden, tweeting that it “feeds into Putin’s narrative.”', 'Russian forces appear stalled. With Russia’s advance on Ukraine’s major cities stalled and satellite imagery showing soldiers digging into defensive positions around Kyiv, a consensus is emerging in the West that the war has reached a bloody stalemate.', 'Mariupol is still suffering. Russian forces continued to bombard the besieged coastal city, hitting a\xa0drama school\xa0where 400 people were hiding, according to local officials. The city’s mayor said thousands of residents had been forcibly deported to Russia.', 'A Ukrainian base is hit. A missile attack on barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv killed more than 40 marines, a Ukrainian official said. That would make it one of the single deadliest attacks on Ukrainian forces since the start of the war, and the death toll could be much higher.', 'Putin does not want direct negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly called for direct negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the hope of ending the war, but Mr. Putin does not think the time is right for talks, according to a senior Turkish official.', 'But those with a pro-Russia stance have gotten louder online. Before the invasion, the Gateway Pundit, a far-right website, published a story listing “fun facts” about Russia and Ukraine, including the Russian talking points that are being used as justification for an invasion. The article spread in Facebook groups that support Mr. Trump, reaching up to 565,100 followers, according to data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned analytics tool.', 'On a podcast on Wednesday, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former adviser, also praised Mr. Putin as “anti-woke.” He suggested the Ukrainian conflict was “not our fight.”', 'After Russia’s attack began, some online users explained Mr. Putin’s motives by blending them with conspiracy theories about Covid-19. One Twitter account named War Clandestine declared that Mr. Putin was targeting biolabs in Ukraine that were operated by the United States. The idea was made more believable, the author said, because of the conspiracy theory that the United States engineered Covid-19 at a lab in Wuhan, China.', 'Pro-America influencers like Mikel Crump and John Basham, who have a combined following of 99,200, amplified the thread. Twitter later suspended the War Clandestine account, plus a second one by the same user for trying to evade the ban, but people continued posting screen recordings of the thread online.', 'Twitter said that the accounts by the user were permanently suspended for violating its abusive behavior policy and that it was monitoring for emerging narratives that violate its rules. Mr. Crump and Mr. Basham did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ', 'Some pro-Russia commentators insisted they were right. Many blamed Mr. Biden, dredging up old conspiracy theories about his son Hunter and Hunter’s employment at a Ukrainian gas company when Mr. Biden was vice president and engaged in diplomatic efforts with the country. There was no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, but conservatives seized on the narrative during the 2020 election.', 'When reached for comment, Mr. Oltmann, the conservative podcaster, said, “You really have no idea about Ukraine. People support Russia because you did not do the right thing when it came to the fraud and corruption of Biden. I pray for the people in Ukraine but equally pray the people who facilitated the evil communist agenda in the U.S. are held accountable.”', 'In an email, Ms. Owens, the conservative talk show host, also said the Russia-Ukraine war was Mr. Biden’s fault. “Ukrainians are dying because of the Biden family’s criminal connections and insistence on stoking conflict in the region,” she said.', 'The growing appreciation for Mr. Putin was captured in recent polling from the Economist and YouGov, which showed he was viewed more favorably by Republicans than Mr. Biden. Another recent poll from Yahoo News and YouGov found that 62 percent of Republicans believed Mr. Putin was a “stronger leader” than Mr. Biden.', 'That sentiment was echoed in an informal poll online on Wednesday, when a QAnon influencer asked followers in the Patriot Voice group on Telegram if they trusted Mr. Putin.

Reels are also taking prime real estate at the top of the screen when people open the Facebook app. Maybe soon we’ll see Reels of used cars that are listed on Facebook’s version of Craigslist.', 'Shoving Reels into our eye holes is a little bit sad, a little bit brilliant — and worth watching as a test of Facebook’s ability to will itself into continued popularity. Leveraging success to make further success is how dominant companies win — and it has worked for Facebook before — but it’s also how dominant companies lose.', 'Facebook might be the most interesting technology story to watch in 2022. The company could be on the cusp of the last days of an empire or about to reinvent itself again and become even more popular and richer.', 'We might not want to admit it, but the fate of Facebook and its strategies affect us all. This company’s choices about which features to prioritize influence how billions of people interact, the ways that businesses reach their customers and the look and feel of the rest of the internet.', 'Reels is an essential part of Facebook’s strategy to head off the company’s worst fears about losing its appeal to young people and shriveling into irrelevance. Facebook wants some of that TikTok coolness, and it made its own version of that app for Instagram.', 'It’s not clear if Reels is a particularly effective copycat of TikTok, but it might not matter.', 'Facebook has said that Reels is catching on and that people using its apps are increasing the time they spend with the videos more than almost anything else. The company expanded Reels from Instagram to the Facebook app and now into more spots in those apps and in more countries. The company is also experimenting with financial incentives to compel more professional internet entertainers to make Reels.', 'We can’t really know for sure how popular Reels are or why. Are people latching on to Reels because they like them, or because they’re just there? Google said recently that videos from its own version of TikTok, YouTube Shorts, are viewed 15 billion times each day. The number is so big that I didn’t believe it at first, but I should have. Google has billions of users, and that is a valuable asset to grab attention for new things.', 'Maybe Facebook’s versions of TikTok, Zoom or Nextdoor aren’t great, but the company has many ways to nudge the billions of people using its apps to try them. The company can see what people seem to like and don’t, tinker and keep making a new product better — and unavoidable — until it takes hold.', 'That’s pretty much what Facebook did about five years ago with Stories, its copycat of the most popular feature on Snapchat. Facebook experimented with the video-and-photo chronicles of people’s days on Instagram and made them prominent in the company’s apps, and then they won.', 'The playbook for Reels seems almost identical, and Facebook executives have essentially said to investors: Hey, we made Stories catch on and we’ll do it with Reels, too. Putting its muscle behind new products isn’t foolproof for Facebook. This isn’t even the company’s first try at copying TikTok.', 'Following other tech companies’ leads doesn’t make Facebook seem inventive, although it might not matter.

The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. New York and Minnesota also joined the lawsuit.', 'A spokeswoman for Optum, the UnitedHealth subsidiary, said in a statement that the Justice Department’s “deeply flawed position is based on highly speculative theories that do not reflect the realities of the health care system,” and added that the company would “defend our case vigorously.” A spokeswoman for Change Healthcare said it was still “working toward closing the merger as we comply with our obligations under the merger agreement.”', 'The deal is the latest transaction to run into opposition from the Biden administration, which has made countering corporate consolidation a central part of its economic agenda. President Biden signed an executive order last year to spur competition in different industries. He also appointed Lina Khan, a prominent critic of the tech giants, to lead the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter, a lawyer who has represented large companies, as chief of antitrust efforts at the Justice Department.', 'Since then, the F.T.C. has blocked Lockheed Martin from buying a maker of missile propulsion systems and the chip giant Nvidia from purchasing the design firm Arm. Even before Mr. Kanter was confirmed, the Justice Department sued to block the merger of two major insurance brokers; the purchase of Simon & Schuster by the publisher Penguin Random House; and a deal that would have married some of JetBlue’s operations with American Airlines’.', '“It’s part and parcel of this effort to make sure that markets truly are competitive,” said William Baer, who previously served as the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division.', 'In a statement, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said the agency “is committed to challenging anticompetitive mergers, particularly those at the intersection of health care and data.”', 'Optum said last year that it would buy Change Healthcare, a company that offers technology services to insurers. UnitedHealth is one of the largest health corporations in the country, with $287.6 billion in revenue in 2021. In addition to its health care information technology business, its Optum unit owns physician practices, a large chain of surgery centers and one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit managers.', 'At the center of the Justice Department’s lawsuit is the data that Change Healthcare gathers when it helps process insurance claims. The department argued that the deal would enable UnitedHealth to see the rules that its competitors used to process claims and undercut them. UnitedHealth could also crunch data about patients at other insurers to gain a competitive advantage, the agency said.', 'The lawsuit claims that, according to a UnitedHealth estimate, more than half of American medical insurance claims “pass through (or touch)” Change Healthcare’s systems. It says that UnitedHealth’s former chief executive saw the tech company’s data as the “foundation” of the reasoning behind the deal.', 'The lawsuit also argued that UnitedHealth could withhold Change Healthcare’s products — which other insurers use — from its rivals or save some of its new innovations for itself. The Justice Department added that the deal would give UnitedHealth a monopoly over a type of service that was used to screen insurance claims for errors and speed up processing.', 'The companies have said the acquisition will improve efficiency in the industry. They also explored selling the part of Change Healthcare that the Justice Department said would give UnitedHealth a new monopoly.', 'Lawmakers and regulators have increasingly worried that big businesses could use troves of data to hurt their rivals. A congressional committee has investigated whether Amazon uses data from outside merchants who use its platform to develop competing products, for example. Critics of Facebook have also argued that the company’s having years of user data makes it difficult for an upstart service to challenge its dominance.', 'Since Mr. Kanter joined the antitrust division at the Justice Department, critics have said he should not oversee cases against companies whose rivals he represented while in private practice. According to a financial disclosure form he filed last year, he once represented Cigna, a major insurer that competes with UnitedHealth, and the remote health care company Teladoc.', 'Mr. Kanter has not participated in the lawsuit against UnitedHealth, a person familiar with the Justice Department’s case said.', 'Reed Abelson contributed reporting.']","['UnitedHealth', 'Justice', 'Department', 'company', 'datum', 'health', 'Healthcare', 'deal', 'Change', 'lawsuit', 'insurance', 'Kanter', 'merger', 'care', 'year', 'insurer', 'rival', 'system', 'case', 'business']",images/124.png

It also allows American officials to restrict exports to Russia from any country in the world if they use American technology, including software or machinery.', 'Companies can seek licenses to sidestep the restrictions but they are likely to be denied.', 'Daleep Singh, the deputy national security adviser, said on Friday that the administration was “converging on the final package” of sanctions and export controls, and suggested that those controls would target tech products.', '“We produce the most sophisticated technological inputs across a range of foundational technologies — A.I., quantum, biotech, hypersonic flight, robotics,” Mr. Singh said. “As we and our partners move in lock step to deny these critical technology inputs to Russia’s economy, Putin’s desire to diversify outside of oil and gas — which is two-thirds of his export revenue, half of his budget revenues — that will be denied.”', '“He’s spoken many times about a desire for an aerospace sector, a defense sector, an I.T. sector,” Mr. Singh said of Mr. Putin. “Without these critical technology inputs, there is no path to realizing those ambitions.”', 'Kevin Wolf, a partner in international trade at Akin Gump who worked in export controls under the Obama administration, said the White House could tailor its use of export controls to target certain strategic sectors, for example companies in the aerospace or maritime industry, while bypassing products used by the Russian populace, like washing machines.', '“They’re making it clear they’re not trying to take action that harms ordinary Russians,” Mr. Wolf said.', 'Andy Shoyer, co-lead of global arbitration, trade and advocacy for Sidley Austin, said the restrictions appeared likely to focus on semiconductors and semiconductor equipment. The novel export controls that the United States wielded against Huawei have a powerful reach when it comes to semiconductors, since even chips made abroad are mostly manufactured and tested using machinery based on American designs, he said.', '“It’s not just what’s physically exported from the U.S.,” Mr. Shoyer said. “It could encompass a substantial amount of production, because so much of the semiconductor industry relies on U.S. technology.”', 'The global semiconductor industry, which has been roiled by shortages and supply chain disruptions throughout the pandemic, could face more disruptions given Ukraine’s role in the semiconductor supply chain.', 'Rising concerns.

Economists estimated that sanctions imposed by Western nations cost Russia $50 billion a year.', 'Since then, the global market for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets has ballooned. That’s bad news for enforcers of sanctions, and good news for Russia.', 'On Tuesday, the Biden administration enacted fresh sanctions on Russia over the conflict in Ukraine, aiming to thwart its access to foreign capital. But Russian entities are preparing to blunt some of the worst effects by making deals with anyone around the world willing to work with them, experts said. And, they say, those entities can then use digital currencies to bypass the control points that governments rely on — mainly transfers of money by banks — to block deal execution.', '“Russia has had a lot of time to think about this specific consequence,” said Michael Parker, a former federal prosecutor who now heads the anti-money-laundering and sanctions practice at the Washington law firm Ferrari & Associates. “It would be naïve to think that they haven’t gamed out exactly this scenario.”', 'Sanctions are some of the most powerful tools the United States and European countries have to influence the behavior of nations they don’t consider allies. The United States in particular is able to use sanctions as a diplomatic tool because the dollar is the world’s reserve currency and used in payments worldwide. But American government officials are increasingly aware of the potential for cryptocurrencies to lessen the impact of sanctions and are stepping up their scrutiny of digital assets.', 'To apply sanctions, a government makes a list of people and businesses its citizens must avoid. Anyone caught engaging with a member of the list faces heavy fines. But the real key to any effective sanctions program is the global financial system. Banks around the world play a major role in enforcement: They see where money comes from and where it’s bound, and anti-money-laundering laws require them to block transactions with entities that are under sanctions and report what they see to authorities. But if banks are the eyes and ears of governments in this space, the explosion of digital currencies is blinding them.', 'Banks have to abide by “know your customer” rules, which include verifying their clients’ identities. But exchanges and other platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies and digital assets are rarely as good at tracking their customers as banks are, even though they are supposed to follow the same rules. In October, the U.S. Treasury Department warned that cryptocurrencies posed an increasingly serious threat to the American sanctions program and that U.S. authorities needed to educate themselves about the technology.', 'Should it choose to evade sanctions, Russia has multiple cryptocurrency-related tools at its disposal, experts said. All it needs is to find ways to trade without touching the dollar.', 'The Russian government is developing its own central bank digital currency, a so-called digital ruble that it hopes to use to trade directly with other countries willing to accept it without first converting it into dollars. Hacking techniques like ransomware could help Russians steal digital currencies and make up revenue lost to sanctions.', 'And while cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on the underlying blockchain, making them transparent, new tools developed in Russia can help mask the origin of such transactions. That would allow businesses to trade with Russian entities without detection.', 'There is a precedent for these kinds of workarounds. Iran and North Korea are among countries that have used digital currencies to mitigate the effects of Western sanctions, a trend that U.S. and United Nations officials have recently observed. North Korea, for instance, has used ransomware to steal cryptocurrency to fund its nuclear program, according to a U.N. report.', 'In October 2020, representatives of Russia’s central bank told a Moscow newspaper that the new “digital ruble” would make the country less dependent on the United States and better able to resist sanctions. It would let Russian entities conduct transactions outside the international banking system with any country willing to trade in digital currency.', 'Russia could find willing partners in other nations targeted by U.S. sanctions, including Iran, that are also developing government-backed digital currencies. China, Russia’s largest trading partner in both imports and exports, according to the World Bank, has already launched its own central bank digital currency. The country’s leader, Xi Jinping, recently described China’s relationship with Russia as having “no limits.”', 'The developing system in which central banks directly exchange digital currencies creates new risks, said Yaya Fanusie, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security who has studied the effects of cryptocurrency on sanctions. “The lessening of U.S. sanctions power comes from a system where these nation-states are able to do transactions without going through the global banking system.”', 'In early February, independent sanctions monitors told the U.N. Security Council that North Korea was using cryptocurrencies to fund its nuclear and ballistic missile program, according to Reuters. (A spokesman for Norway’s permanent mission to the U.N. confirmed the existence of the report, which has not yet been made public.) In May, the consulting firm Elliptic described how Iran was using revenue from Bitcoin mining to make up for the limitations on its ability to sell oil because of sanctions.', 'Russian entities that are under sanctions could deploy their own evasion strategy, using ransomware attacks. The playbook is straightforward: A hacker breaks into computer networks and locks up digital information until the victim pays for its release, usually in cryptocurrency.', 'Rising concerns.

Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.', 'Russia is at the center of the growing ransomware industry. Last year, about 74 percent of global ransomware revenue, or more than $400 million worth of cryptocurrency, went to entities that are probably affiliated with Russia in some way, according to a Feb. 14 report by the blockchain-tracking firm Chainalysis.', 'Illegal funds have also flowed into Russia through a dark web marketplace called Hydra, which is powered by cryptocurrency and handled more than $1 billion in sales in 2020, according to Chainalysis. The platform’s strict rules — sellers are allowed to liquidate cryptocurrency only through certain regional exchanges — have made it difficult for researchers to follow the money.', '“We know that there’s no questions asked, and we know that Hydra operates not just throughout Eastern Europe but throughout Western Europe,” said Kim Grauer, director of research at Chainalysis. “There’s definitely cross-border business happening.”', 'Digital currencies all use blockchain technology, a form of computer code that is publicly viewable by anyone, anywhere. This public ledger keeps track of the movements of individual digital coins from one “wallet” — as online repositories for digital assets are called — to another. In theory, this should let authorities track all crypto transactions and keep restricted entities from completing them.', 'But the technology behind Hydra masks the source of transactions, offering a potential tool for Russian users to move money outside the country’s borders. On its own, Hydra is not yet big enough to handle the volume of transactions that Russia would need to successfully evade sanctions. But other money-laundering techniques — including “nesting,” in which an illicit marketplace buries itself within a larger, legitimate structure to hide its activities — could also help.', 'There are signs that the United States is stepping up its monitoring of cryptocurrency activity. On Feb. 17, the Justice Department announced that it had created a new national cryptocurrency enforcement team, a move that seemed to emphasize that federal prosecutors were paying extra attention to bad behavior among cryptocurrency users.', 'Mr. Parker, the former prosecutor, said the Feb. 8 arrests of a Manhattan couple for stealing $3.6 billion in Bitcoin from the Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex were “a tangible example of the government getting very good and up to speed on what they need to do to be able to trace this.”', 'Administration officials are also urging the cryptocurrency industry to put into place internal controls that prevent bad actors from using their services. In October, the Treasury Department published a 30-page sanctions-compliance manual recommending that cryptocurrency companies use geolocation tools to weed out customers in restricted jurisdictions. In many cases, the report said, crypto companies have taken months or years to carry out such compliance procedures.', 'That may change as the industry starts to mature. Chainalysis offers a “know your transaction” tool that alerts companies when blacklisted entities use their services. Last year, the company doubled its number of private-sector customers, many of whom use the compliance tool.', 'But savvy cryptocurrency users can find ways around a blacklist.', '“A Treasury designation of a crypto wallet address is not foolproof,” said Mr. Fanusie of the Center for a New American Security. “That designated actor can still open up a new wallet elsewhere.

Or maybe?', 'Fresh data from the U.S. government shows something that surprised me: Physical stores beat online shopping in 2021. No joke.', 'Americans spent 18 percent more on food, cars, furniture, electronics and other retail products last year compared with 2020, the Commerce Department disclosed on Friday. Online retail sales increased by 14 percent. In other words, e-commerce lost ground last year to brick-and-mortar stores.', 'Admittedly, 2021 was a strange year for shopping. More of us had the urge to browse in person than we did in the scary first months of Covid in the U.S. Climbing prices and shortages changed what people bought and where they shopped. And one year doesn’t alter the long-term trend that online shopping is grabbing more of Americans’ wallets.', 'But the comeback for physical stores also points to how difficult it can be to predict the speed at which technologies alter our behaviors and the effects if and when they do. The future does not necessarily arrive in a straight line.', 'My point isn’t confined to shopping, either. One of the big debates for our economies and lives is how much the coronavirus and the digital adaptations to it might permanently alter all aspects of how we spend our time, including the future of office work, moviegoing and exercise habits. The honest answer is that we don’t really know. Much has changed, but a lot has not.', 'Brian Wieser is one of my favorite numbers nerds, and he alerted me to the fact that physical stores won in 2021. Wieser, the global president of business intelligence for the advertising firm GroupM, said that he’d taken to zooming out in two-year blocks of time to assess the disruptive effects of the pandemic on businesses and us.', 'Wieser described what he’d seen as a “new plateau” — the pandemic accelerated digital trends that were already happening and kicked our usage to a higher level. A lot of people who research human behavior have likewise talked about the ways that we’ve reached familiarity with e-commerce, remote work, telemedicine and online socializing that might not have happened until 2025 or later absent a pandemic.', 'Wieser’s data crunching shows that we increased our shopping online more in 2020 and 2021 than we had in any two-year period since 2006. Amazon and Walmart have also encouraged their investors to look at two-year chunks of time. At Amazon, this may have been motivated in part by lackluster sales. During the last six months of 2021, Amazon showed the slowest rate of revenue growth in 20 years.', 'Juozas Kaziukėnas, the founder of the e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse, posed a question to me a couple of months ago that I haven’t been able to forget: Did the coronavirus really compel us to shop online more — or just shop more, period?', 'It’s a confusing time to assess what technology has changed in us. Wieser’s visual metaphor of a plateau is useful. Maybe we’ve reached a new level of familiarity with and use of technologies. That doesn’t mean we can predict where we go from this new perch.', 'We (myself included) are still terrible at predicting the future of technology and how people and societies respond to it. Sometimes a new app that we can’t stop talking about turns out to be Instagram, and sometimes it’s Ello. (Don’t remember Ello?

They must now try to deliver relevant results for obscure search terms and avoid surfacing possible misinformation, all while steering clear of censorship claims.', 'DuckDuckGo, which has about 3 percent of the United States search market, holds little direct control over the links in its search results because they are generated by the search engine algorithm provided by Bing, which Microsoft owns. And all search engine algorithms are considered black boxes because the companies that create them do not completely disclose what informs their decisions.', 'In a statement, DuckDuckGo said it condemned “acts of disinformation” and said the company’s internal surveys showed that its users had a wide mix of political orientations. The company said it was also studying ways to limit the spread of false and misleading information.', 'For a glimpse at what conspiracy theorists encounter when they search online, The New York Times reviewed the top 20 search results on Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo for more than 30 conspiracy theories and right-wing topics. Search results can change over time and vary among users, but the comparisons provide a snapshot of what a single user might have seen on a typical day in mid-February.', 'For many terms, Bing and DuckDuckGo surfaced more untrustworthy websites than Google did, when results were compared with website ratings from the Global Disinformation Index, NewsGuard and research published in the journal Science. (While DuckDuckGo relies on Bing’s algorithm, their search results can differ.)', 'Search results on Google also included some untrustworthy websites, but they tended to be less common and lower on the search page.', 'The Times then reviewed a selection of those terms to check whether the content on the linked pages advanced the conspiracy theory or not. Those comparisons often showed even sharper differences between Google and its competitors.', 'Those findings matched results from two recent studies, which concluded that Bing’s algorithm surfaced content more supportive of conspiracy theories than Google did.', 'Differences among search engines in The Times’s analysis were clearest when the terms were specific. For instance, searching for “Satanist Democrats,” a theory that Democrats worship Satan or perform satanic rituals, surfaced several links advancing the conspiracy theory. But searching for more established claims, like the “QAnon” movement or terms unrelated to conspiracies, surfaced more trustworthy results from all search engines.', 'Explore some of the searches using the drop-down below.', 'The role of search engines has grown as online conspiracy theorists have placed more value on what they call “doing your research,” which involves digging for content online to deepen conspiracy theories rather than relying on mainstream news outlets or government sources.', '“Research, research, research,” a Telegram user wrote in a channel devoted to fighting vaccine mandates. “Stay AWAY from Google searches, only use DuckDuckGo.”', 'When people hunt for new information online, they tend to hold those findings in higher regard, said Ronald E. Robertson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Stanford Internet Observatory who has studied search engines.', '“It’s a lot more convincing to look up information, find it and feel that sense of discovery about it,” he said. “You don’t really feel like someone’s telling you what the truth is, like you might on social media.”', 'DuckDuckGo said it “regularly” flagged problematic search terms with\xa0Bing so they could be addressed. After The Times shared some data on search results for numerous terms spread by conspiracy theorists, several of the search results changed entirely, shifting to favor more trustworthy sources.', '“Finding the right balance between delivering authoritative results that match the intent of a search query and protecting users from being misled is a very challenging problem,” Bing said in a statement, adding: “We won’t always get that balance just right, but that’s our goal.”', 'Kamyl Bazbaz, the vice president of communications for DuckDuckGo, said that its results were often similar to Google’s and that most search terms reviewed by The Times received nearly no traffic.', 'While Google tended to surface links from trustworthy news sources more often, Mr. Bazbaz said adding a few more keywords to any given search usually surfaced the misleading information on Google anyway.', '“If you’re looking for this stuff, no matter where you’re searching for it, you can find it,” he said.', 'Other research has also found that Bing’s algorithm surfaces less trustworthy information than Google does when searching for conspiracy theories. One study last year showed that slightly fewer than half of all results on Bing and DuckDuckGo for six popular conspiracy theories mentioned or promoted the ideas. Google fared better, with about a quarter of links mentioning the ideas but nearly none supporting them. Yahoo fared worse than Bing and DuckDuckGo, and the Russian search engine Yandex fared worst among the group.', 'Newer and more esoteric conspiracy theories are far more likely to return misleading results because of the so-called data void. Conspiracy theorists tend to publish content about new ideas long before mainstream sources, dominating search results as the terms begin spreading online. Other topics never grab the attention of mainstream sources, giving the conspiracy theorists a long-term presence in search results.', 'Search engines have long been criticized for failing to address data voids. That criticism increased during the 2016 presidential election, when the spread of misleading and false news stories caused growing alarm among misinformation watchdogs. Around the same time, Google users noticed that a search for “did the Holocaust happen” surfaced a white supremacist website as its top result. Google tweaked its algorithm in response, now weighing a website’s reliability to a greater extent, alongside the content’s relevance to the search term.', 'Since 2021, Google has also automatically added warning boxes stating that “results are changing quickly” for terms that gain sudden popularity.', 'That warning appeared after Dr. Robert Malone, an infectious-disease researcher, appeared on “The Joe Rogan Experience” late last year. In that interview, Dr. Malone raised the discredited idea of mass formation psychosis, which describes a kind of groupthink mentality that supposedly persuaded the public to support pandemic countermeasures.', 'After the show, interest in the search term exploded, and the warning label appeared on Google’s results. Dr. Malone’s fans quickly claimed Google had targeted the term and removed links or edited the search results.', 'In a statement, Google said, “There is no merit to the suggestion that search results were manually edited.” But the company added that its algorithm would automatically adjust itself in some cases, shifting to rank trustworthy links higher than more relevant ones.', 'To combat data voids, search engines have also peppered their search results with information boxes surfacing more trustworthy information, like news carousels showing articles from trusted media sources higher in the search results. DuckDuckGo said it was working with researchers at Princeton University’s Center for Information Technology Policy to study how to mitigate disinformation through information boxes and “instant answers,” which the company already uses to augment results from Bing’s search algorithm.', 'Daniel Bush, a postdoctoral fellow at the Stanford Internet Observatory, warned that the automated nature of search engines meant that conspiracy theorists would continue to prey on data voids to promote misleading information online.', '“The data void is the key problem at the core of this technology, and there’s no algorithm that can fix it,” said Mr. Bush, who analyzed search results in 2019 and showed misinformation was more prevalent on Bing than on Google. “The more automated things become, the more vulnerable we are.”', 'Audio produced by Adrienne Hurst.']","['search', 'result', 'conspiracy', 'engine', 'term', 'theory', 'Google', 'information', 'theorist', 'Bing', 'link', 'Times', 'source', 'user', 'company', 'datum', 'duckduckgo', 'research', 'website', 'content']",images/130.png

Here is a collection of past columns.', 'Who wins when governments go head-to-head with technology giants — and whom should we root for?', 'We’re getting a small test of that question in the Netherlands. Last year, the Dutch equivalent of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission became one of the first regulators in the world to require Apple to give people multiple payment options for using dating apps on their phones. It was a tiny crack in the absolute control Apple has asserted over iPhone apps since 2008.', 'This has now become a standoff between the world’s most valuable company and Dutch bureaucrats. Apple has proposed a workaround, but the regulator calls Apple’s attitude “regrettable” and has issued weekly fines totaling 25 million euros (about $28 million). Apple says that iPhone owners’ security and convenience would be compromised if it allowed this, but also says that the company is complying with its legal obligations.', 'I wouldn’t normally pay attention to a relatively minor regulatory beef, but the company is fighting as if it’s a big deal. Apple’s response is also revealing about how tech superpowers react to governments’ efforts to alter the role of technologies.', 'More authorities everywhere in the world — in both democratic and authoritarian countries — want to make tech companies change what they’re doing. The tech giants tend to say that they follow the laws wherever they operate. But they also push back against governments and deflect or shape laws and regulations. And it’s not always easy to tell the difference between righteous defiance and corporate impunity.', 'For example, democracy advocates have criticized Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Google for not doing more to push back against government efforts to censor political speech in countries like Vietnam, India and Russia. After mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015 and in Pensacola, Fla., in 2019, internet evangelists praised Apple for refusing to help the F.B.I. break into the killers’ iPhones.', 'The Netherlands became an unlikely high-stakes tech battleground starting in 2019, when the Authority for Consumers and Markets began investigating whether Apple’s app storefront broke the country’s laws against abuses of power.', 'The broad issue is the same one that Apple is facing everywhere from Fargo, N.D., to Seoul and many world capitals and courtrooms in between. Some authorities and developers say that Apple unfairly controls our smartphones and digital economy by requiring that iPhone apps be downloaded through its app store. There, the company sets the rules about what content is appropriate and collects a commission of up to 30 percent on some purchases.', 'App developers including Match Group, the U.S. company that owns Tinder, Match.com and other dating services, used the Dutch investigation to air their grievances about Apple. Match wanted more options that go around Apple’s store to direct people to pay for dating services.', 'In August, the A.C.M. issued an order that prohibited Apple from requiring dating apps to use only the company’s payment system, which enables Apple to collect a fee. It might not look like much, but the Netherlands could be one of the first dominoes in loosening Apple’s grip on the app economy.', 'In response, Apple last month proposed a set of conditions that some app developers said was a hostile defiance of the Dutch regulator. Apple essentially said that dating apps in the country could use any payment system they wanted, but that Apple would collect a fee of 27 cents on each dollar of purchases that people made in the app, and require the dating companies to hand over information and audit it.', 'Try to imagine if Walmart said that shoppers could pay any way they wanted, but that it might cost more if you used a non-Walmart credit card and you had to give Walmart your card’s monthly statement.', 'People who keep close tabs on Apple have said that its approach in the Netherlands is probably a blueprint for other cases in which judges or regulators try to force the company to do things it doesn’t want to do with its app store.', 'Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s antitrust chief, addressed Apple’s behavior in a speech on Tuesday. “Some gatekeepers may be tempted to play for time or try to circumvent the rules,” she said. “Apple’s conduct in the Netherlands these days may be an example.”', 'The regulator says that Apple’s new conditions don’t comply with the A.C.M. order. “Apple’s so-called ‘solutions’ continue to create too many barriers for dating-app providers that wish to use their own payment systems,” a spokesman for the A.C.M. said in a statement Monday.', 'A court in the Netherlands will most likely have to resolve the dispute with Apple. All regulation is slow and complicated, but this dispute shows that those involving tech companies with deep pockets might be even more so. The question now is whether Apple will fight current and future attempts to change its app store with the vigor it has in the Netherlands — and whether we’ll be better or worse off if it does.', 'The future of work in physical offices is up in the air, but tech companies are on an office-expansion binge, my colleague Kellen Browning writes.

In January, 48 percent of people in computer and math fields and 35 percent of those in architecture or engineering said they had worked from home at some point because of the pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.', 'But companies, real estate analysts and workplace experts said several factors were propelling the trend, including a hiring boom, a race to attract and retain top talent and a sense that offices will play a key role in the future of work. In the last three quarters of 2021, the tech industry leased 76 percent more office space than it did a year earlier, according to the real estate company CBRE.', '“I think there are a lot more companies that are saying, ‘You’re coming back to work’ — it’s not ‘if,’ it’s ‘when,’” said Victor Coleman, the chief executive of Hudson Pacific Properties, a real estate investment group. “The reality is that most companies are currently working from home but are wanting and planning to come back to the office.”', 'Debates over whether workers should be required to return to the office can be thorny because some employees say they have been happier and more productive at home. One way companies are trying to lure them back is by splurging on prime office space with great amenities.', 'Big Tech executives say that office expansions are to be expected and that modernized buildings will probably be spaces for people to collaborate rather than stare at screens. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, leased 730,000 square feet in Midtown Manhattan in August 2020, and has added space in Silicon Valley as well as in Austin, Texas; Boston; Chicago; and Bellevue, Wash.', '“We will continue to grow and expect many people to return to our offices around the world once it’s safe,” said Tracy Clayton, a Meta spokesman.', 'Google said early last year that it would spend $7 billion on new and expanded offices and data centers around the country in 2021, including $2.1 billion to buy a Manhattan office building by the Hudson River, and growth in Atlanta; Silicon Valley; Boulder, Colo.; Durham, N.C.; and Pittsburgh. Google also said in January that it would spend $1 billion on a London office building.', 'Offices “remain an important part of supporting our hybrid approach to work in the future,” Google said in a statement.', 'During the pandemic, Microsoft has expanded in Houston; Miami; Atlanta; New York; Arlington, Va.; and Hillsboro, Ore. The company was growing to accommodate the many new employees it has hired over the last two years, said Jared Spataro, the vice president of modern work for Microsoft.', '“The pandemic, I think, has just changed people’s perception of what’s possible in terms of geographic distribution,” Mr. Spataro said.', 'In April, Apple said it would build a campus near Raleigh, N.C., and has added space in San Diego and Silicon Valley. The company, which has battled with its employees over its plan for a majority of workers to return to offices most days each week, referred to its April news release about expansion but declined to comment further.', 'Salesforce, whose signature tower looms over the San Francisco skyline, is moving forward with four new office towers planned before the pandemic, in Tokyo, Dublin, Chicago and Sydney, Australia. The company said last February that many employees could be fully remote, but shifted its messaging months later, saying that “something is missing” without office life and urging workers to come back in.', 'Salesforce’s thinking about the office has evolved, said Steve Brashear, the company’s senior vice president in charge of real estate. At the start of the pandemic, the feeling was that “being remote sounds so great and so safe,” Mr. Brashear said. Now, “the idea of being isolated as a remote worker has its drawbacks.”', 'The industry’s search for land has been so extensive that it has surged through longtime tech hubs like Silicon Valley and into areas not traditionally known for their tech scenes.', 'In Phoenix, for instance, tech leasing activity grew more than 300 percent from mid-2020 to mid-2021. New leases, subleases and renewals in the area totaled more than one million square feet from April through September last year, up from about 260,000 square feet a year earlier, according to CBRE.', 'Other locations not normally associated with tech also saw growth. In Vancouver, British Columbia, tech leasing activity doubled in growth in mid-2021, to 561,000 square feet from 268,000, as did activity in Charlotte, N.C., to 143,000 square feet from 71,000.', 'Amazon has been one of the most prolific in expansion, announcing in 2020 that it would increase its white-collar work force in half a dozen cities. In Phoenix, its logo is ubiquitous, and it will occupy five floors in the new Tempe office building expected to be finished this year.', 'Holly Sullivan, Amazon’s vice president of economic development, said adding to its regional hubs allowed the company “to tap into wider and more diverse talent pools, provide increased flexibility for current and future employees, and create more jobs and economic opportunity across the country.”', 'For developers, the focus on offices is good for business, and some interpret the growth as an indictment of the fully remote model.', 'The thinking on remote work is “like a pendulum — it swung a little bit too far, and now it’s come back a little bit,” said George Forristall, the Phoenix real estate director at Mortenson Development.', 'The flurry of expansions also highlights how much better tech has fared than other industries during the pandemic. In some cities, remote work and high vacancy rates continue to hurt restaurants and retailers.', 'Office vacancy rates in San Francisco climbed to 22.4 percent at the end of 2021 from 21.5 percent in the third quarter of the year, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate firm. The city’s economists called tourism and office vacancies “special areas of concern in the city’s economic outlook.” In New York, office vacancy rates declined to 14.6 percent, according to JLL, but areas dependent on office workers to power local businesses, like Midtown Manhattan, are recovering more slowly.', 'Smaller tech companies, given their financial constraints, might have to choose whether to invest in physical spaces or embrace a more flexible strategy. Twitter has continued to add offices in Silicon Valley, and video game developers like Electronic Arts and Epic Games have expanded in places like Canada and North Carolina. But others have cut back.', 'Zynga, a gaming company, offered up its 185,000-square-foot San Francisco headquarters for sublease last summer because it decided that shrinking its physical office and moving would make life easier for employees, said Ken Stuart, vice president of real estate at Zynga. Its new building in San Mateo, Calif., will be less than half the size.', '“The reality is that people are frustrated by the commute and getting into the city, and also people feel like they can do better work by being hybrid,” Mr. Stuart said.', 'By contrast, the largest tech giants “have so much money that it doesn’t matter,” said Anne Helen Petersen, a co-author of “Out of Office,” a recent book about the remote-work era. Because of their huge budgets, Ms. Petersen suggested, such companies can continue constructing offices without worrying about how much money they stand to lose if the buildings become obsolete.', '“They’re hedging their bets,” Ms. Petersen said. “If the future’s going to be fully distributed, ‘we’ll be setting up an apparatus for that.’ If the future’s going to rubber-band back to everyone back to the office, the way it was in 2020, ‘we’ll go back to that.’”', 'In Tempe, the two-floor WeWork co-working space at the Watermark, one of the premier office spaces, was buzzing with activity on a recent afternoon. Upstairs, Amazon has rented an entire floor.', 'Below, amid leafy plants and colorful lighting, employees at tech start-ups clacked away on MacBooks and sketched on whiteboards. Many said it had become more crowded in recent months, and more companies were renting the small office spaces within the WeWork.', 'Sam Jones, a co-founder of a nonfungible token start-up, Honey Haus, said his company had been renting a four-person space within WeWork for $1,850 a month since October.', '“I am just way less productive at home,” Mr. Jones said. “People are definitely, I think, realizing that physical space just has something special to it.”']","['office', 'company', 'space', 'tech', 'building', 'pandemic', 'worker', 'employee', 'estate', 'percent', 'year', 'people', 'work', 'foot', 'area', 'industry', 'Silicon', 'San', 'Phoenix', 'home']",images/137.png

They had never met in person — he was still waiting to get his Covid-19 booster shot, he said — but they had texted back and forth for months and she’d developed a serious crush. He called her his “little sweetheart,” and told her that he was planning to take her to China to meet his family when the pandemic was over.', 'So when the man, who went by the name Ze Zhao, told Ms. Vu, who works in customer service for a security company, that he could help her make money by trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, she was intrigued.', '“I’d heard a lot about crypto in the news,” she said. “I’m a curious person, and he actually was very knowledgeable about the whole trading process.”', 'But the man wasn’t trying to help Ms. Vu invest her money. He was entrapping her in an increasingly popular type of financial scam, she said, one that combines the age-old allure of romance with the newer temptation of overnight cryptocurrency riches.', ""Within weeks, Ms. Vu, 33, had sent more than $300,000 worth of Bitcoin, nearly her entire life savings, to an address that Mr. Zhao had told her was connected to an account on the Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange OSL. The website looked legitimate, offered 24/7 online customer support and had even been updated to show Ms. Vu's balance changing as the price of Bitcoin rose and fell."", 'Mr. Zhao — whose real name could not be verified — had promised her that her crypto investments would help them get married and start a life together.', '“We can make more money on top of OSL and go on a honeymoon,” he said, according to a screenshot of their texts that Ms. Vu shared with me.', ""But there was no honeymoon, and no crypto windfall. Instead of going into an exchange account, Ms. Vu's money went into the scammer’s digital wallet, and he vanished."", 'Now, she is struggling to make sense of what happened.', '“I thought I knew him,” she said. “Everything was a lie.”', 'Romance scams — the term for online scams that involve feigning romantic interest to gain a victim’s trust — have increased in the pandemic. So have crypto prices. That has made crypto a useful entry point for criminals looking to part victims from their savings.', 'About 56,000 romance scams, totaling $139 million in losses, were reported to the Federal Trade Commission last year, according to agency data. That is nearly twice as many reports as the agency received the previous year. In a bulletin last fall, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Oregon office warned that crypto dating scams were emerging as a major category of cybercrime, with more than 1,800 reported cases in the first seven months of the year.', 'Experts believe this particular type of scam originated in China before spreading to the United States and Europe. Its Chinese name translates roughly as “pig butchering” — a reference to the way victims are “fattened up” with flattery and romance before being scammed.', 'Jan Santiago, the deputy director of the Global Anti-Scam Organization, a nonprofit that represents victims of online cryptocurrency scams, said that unlike typical romance scams — which generally target older, less tech-savvy adults — these scammers appear to be going after younger and more educated women on dating apps like Tinder, Bumble and Hinge.', '“It’s mostly millennials who are getting scammed,” Mr. Santiago said.', 'Jane Lee, a researcher at the online fraud-prevention firm Sift, began looking into crypto dating scams last year. She signed up for several popular dating apps and quickly matched with men who tried to offer her investing advice.', '“People are lonely from the pandemic, and crypto is super hot right now,” she said. “The combination of the two has really made this a successful scam.”', 'Ms. Lee, whose company works with several dating apps to prevent fraud, said that these scammers typically tried to move the conversation off a dating app and onto WhatsApp — where messages are encrypted and harder for companies or law enforcement agencies to track.', 'From there, the scammer bombards the victim with flirtatious messages until turning the conversation to cryptocurrency. The scammer, posing as a successful crypto trader, offers to show the victim how to invest his or her money for fast, low-risk gains.', 'Then, Ms. Lee said, the scammer helps the victim buy cryptocurrency on a legitimate site, like Coinbase or Crypto.com, and provides instructions for transferring it to a fake cryptocurrency exchange. The victim’s money appears on the exchange’s website, and he or she starts “investing” it in various crypto assets, under the scammer’s guidance, before the scammer ultimately absconds with the money.', 'What makes this particular scam so insidious is how much more elaborate it is than the Nigerian prince scams of yore. Some victims have described being directed to realistic-looking websites with charts and tickers showing the prices of various crypto assets. The names and addresses of the fake exchanges are changed frequently, and victims are often allowed to withdraw small amounts of money early on, making them more comfortable depositing larger sums later.', '“This kind of scam is quite labor-intensive and time-consuming,” Mr. Santiago, of the Global Anti-Scam Organization, said. “They’re very meticulous in their social engineering.”', 'Cryptocurrencies are particularly useful to scammers, experts say, because of the relative privacy they offer. Bitcoin transactions are publicly visible, but because digital wallets can be set up anonymously, technically sophisticated criminals can obscure the trail of money. And because there is no central bank or deposit insurance to make victims whole, stolen money usually can’t be recovered.', 'Niki Hutchinson, a 24-year-old social media producer from Tennessee, fell victim to a crypto romance scam last year. She was visiting a friend in California when she matched on Hinge with a man named Hao, who said he lived nearby and worked in the clothing business.', 'The two continued texting on WhatsApp for more than a month after she returned home. She told Hao that she was adopted from China; he told her that he was Chinese, too, and that he hailed from the same province as her birth family. He started calling her “sister” and joking that he was her long-lost brother. (They video-chatted once, she said — but Hao only partly showed his face and hung up quickly.)', '“I thought he was shy,” she said.', 'Ms. Hutchinson had just inherited nearly $300,000 from the sale of her childhood home, after her mother died. Hao suggested that she invest that money in cryptocurrency.', 'A glossary. Cryptocurrencies\xa0have gone from a curiosity to a viable investment, making them almost impossible to ignore.

Then — when the money appeared on ICAC’s website — she sent more.', 'She couldn’t believe how easy it had been to make money, just by following Hao’s advice. Eventually, when she’d invested her entire savings, she took out a loan and kept investing more.', 'In December, Ms. Hutchinson started to get suspicious when she tried to withdraw money from her account. The transaction failed, and a customer service agent for ICAC told her that her account would be frozen unless she paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes.

Paul Furber was its first apostle.', 'The outlandish claim made perfect sense to Mr. Furber, a South African software developer and tech journalist long fascinated with American politics and conspiracy theories, he said in an interview. He still clung to “Pizzagate,” the debunked online lie that liberal Satanists were trafficking children from a Washington restaurant. He was also among the few who understood an obscure reference in the message to “Operation Mockingbird,” an alleged C.I.A. scheme to manipulate the news media.', 'As the stream of messages, most signed only “Q,” grew into a sprawling conspiracy theory, the mystery surrounding their authorship became a central fascination for its followers — who was the anonymous Q?', 'Now two teams of forensic linguists say their analysis of the Q texts shows that Mr. Furber, one of the first online commentators to call attention to the earliest messages, actually played the lead role in writing them.', 'Sleuths hunting for the writer behind Q have increasingly overlooked Mr. Furber and focused their speculation on another QAnon booster: Ron Watkins, who operated a website where the Q messages began appearing in 2018 and is now running for Congress in Arizona. And the scientists say they found evidence to back up those suspicions as well. Mr. Watkins appears to have taken over from Mr. Furber at the beginning of 2018. Both deny writing as Q.', 'The studies provide the first empirical evidence of who invented the toxic QAnon myth, and the scientists who conducted the studies said they hoped that unmasking the creators might weaken its hold over QAnon followers.

That evidence, the scientists said, increased their confidence that they had unmasked the main authors.', 'Some QAnon followers had begun to suspect as early as mid-2018 that one or more of the commentators who first claimed to stumble onto the Q messages had actually written them. Without prior knowledge, how could anyone have plucked those almost nonsensical postings out of the online torrent? An NBC news report that summer identified Q’s earliest boosters as Mr. Furber (known online as Baruch the Scribe) and three others. The report emphasized that the three others had possible financial motives for stoking the craze because they had solicited donations for Q “research.” (Mr. Furber did not.)', 'The Swiss team studied writings by those four, as well as by Mr. Watkins and his father, who owns the message board.', 'In addition to examining those six potential authors, the French scientists added seven more to the mix.

Flynn, his onetime national security adviser; the political consultant Roger Stone; and Dan Scavino, a Trump White House deputy chief of staff.', '“At first most of the text is by Furber,” said Mr. Cafiero, who works at the French National Center for Scientific Research. “But the signature of Ron Watkins increased during the first few months as Paul Furber decreased and then dropped completely.”', 'Mr. Furber said in an interview that he had inherited his passion for American politics from his parents, who had taught in Canada and traveled around the United States. He visited often while building a career in software development and writing for trade publications.', 'His fascination with conspiracy theories, he said, began with questions about President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. Then, around 1996, he found a site spinning alternative stories about the suicide of Vincent Foster, the Clinton White House counsel, and other deaths falsely said to be linked to the Clintons. “That sort of kicked off my interest,” he said.', 'The early Q messages, which the scientists say resemble Mr. Furber’s writing, lay out the core QAnon myths and slogans that later messages repeat. That was also when Mr. Furber and a few other early promoters helped attract the interest of entrepreneurial YouTube creators who amplified the messages.', 'But at the start of 2018, both studies found, the writing changed conspicuously. Where the 2017 posts were filled with Socratic questions, the later posts were more declarative and expository, with heavy use of exclamation points and words written in all capital letters. Sometimes, Q shared internet memes.', 'The Q messages had recently jumped from an older message board to the one run by Ron Watkins and owned by his father, Jim — the site known then as 8chan and now as 8kun. Jim Watkins, a former U.S. Army helicopter repairman who had settled in the Philippines, also owned pig and honey farms and dabbled in the online pornography business. Around the 2016 election, he had created a conspiracy-minded pro-Trump website, with his son overseeing the technical side.', 'The evident change in writing style at the start of 2018 coincided with an unusual exchange between the Q account and Ron Watkins. After a period of confusion, whoever was writing as Q publicly asked Mr. Watkins to confirm that the messages were still coming from the original Q.

In writing the Federalist Papers, for example, James Madison favored “whilst” over “while,” and Alexander Hamilton tended to write “upon” instead of “on.”', 'Instead of relying on expert opinion, the computer scientists used a mathematical approach known as stylometry. Practitioners say they have replaced the art of the older studies with a new form of science, yielding results that are measurable, consistent and replicable.', 'Sophisticated software broke down the Q texts into patterns of three-character sequences and tracked the recurrence of each possible combination.', 'Their technique does not highlight memorable, idiosyncratic word choices the way that earlier forensic linguists often did. But the advocates of stylometry note that they can quantify their software’s error rate.', 'The Swiss team said its accuracy rate was about 93 percent. The French team said its software correctly identified Mr. Watkins’s writing in 99 percent of tests and Mr. Furber’s in 98 percent.', 'Machine learning revealed that J.K. Rowling, the creator of Harry Potter, had written the 2013 mystery “Cuckoo’s Calling” under another pen name. The F.B.I. used a form of stylometry to show that Ted Kaczynski was the Unabomber. In recent years, such techniques have helped detectives in the United States and Britain solve murder cases involving a forged suicide note and faked text messages.', 'The teams studying Q got in touch with each other after the Swiss scientists released an earlier, preliminary study showing that the writing had changed over time. Each team applied different techniques. The Swiss scientists used software to measure similarities in the three-character patterns across multiple texts while comparing the complexity of vocabulary and syntax. The French team used a form of artificial intelligence that learns the patterns of an author’s writing in roughly the same way that facial-recognition software learns human features.', 'The teams shared text samples, including more than 100,000 words by Q and at least 12,000 words by each of the 13 other writers they analyzed.', 'Gerald McMenamin of the University of Nevada, Reno, a renowned forensic linguist critical of the machine-learning techniques, said he doubted that software could pick out the telltale individual variations from the quirks of the distinctive voice assumed in the Q messages — full of short sentences, cryptic statements, military jargon and Socratic questions.', 'To counter the danger that texts spanning different forms or genres might confuse the software, the scientists said, they compared other writing samples that were all of the same type: social media posts, primarily tweets. And the writings by Mr. Furber and Mr. Watkins stood out over all the others in similarity to Q’s.', 'David Hoover, an English professor at New York University and an expert in author identification, said the scientists seemed to effectively address the potential problem of Q’s distinctive voice. He found the work “quite persuasive,” he said.', '“I’d buy it,” said Patrick Juola of Duquesne University, a mathematician who identified Ms. Rowling as the author of “Cuckoo’s Calling.”', '“What’s really powerful is the fact that both of the two independent analyses showed the same overall pattern,” Dr. Juola added.', 'Neither team ruled out the possibility that other writers had contributed to Q’s thousands of messages, especially during what appears to have been a period of collaboration between Mr. Furber and Mr. Watkins around late 2017.', 'But the scientists relied on other facts to narrow the list of feasible writers to test. That evidence, the scientists said, increased their confidence that they had unmasked the main authors.', 'Some QAnon followers had begun to suspect as early as mid-2018 that one or more of the commentators who first claimed to stumble onto the Q messages had actually written them. Without prior knowledge, how could anyone have plucked those almost nonsensical postings out of the online torrent? An NBC news report that summer identified Q’s earliest boosters as Mr. Furber (known online as Baruch the Scribe) and three others. The report emphasized that the three others had possible financial motives for stoking the craze because they had solicited donations for Q “research.” (Mr. Furber did not.)', 'The Swiss team studied writings by those four, as well as by Mr. Watkins and his father, who owns the message board.', 'In addition to examining those six potential authors, the French scientists added seven more to the mix. They tested tweets by another online Q booster close to the Watkinses as well as by Mr. Trump, his wife, Melania, his son Eric, and three others close to the former president who had publicly encouraged QAnon: Michael T. Flynn, his onetime national security adviser; the political consultant Roger Stone; and Dan Scavino, a Trump White House deputy chief of staff.', '“At first most of the text is by Furber,” said Mr. Cafiero, who works at the French National Center for Scientific Research. “But the signature of Ron Watkins increased during the first few months as Paul Furber decreased and then dropped completely.”', 'Mr. Furber said in an interview that he had inherited his passion for American politics from his parents, who had taught in Canada and traveled around the United States. He visited often while building a career in software development and writing for trade publications.', 'His fascination with conspiracy theories, he said, began with questions about President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. Then, around 1996, he found a site spinning alternative stories about the suicide of Vincent Foster, the Clinton White House counsel, and other deaths falsely said to be linked to the Clintons. “That sort of kicked off my interest,” he said.', 'The early Q messages, which the scientists say resemble Mr. Furber’s writing, lay out the core QAnon myths and slogans that later messages repeat. That was also when Mr. Furber and a few other early promoters helped attract the interest of entrepreneurial YouTube creators who amplified the messages.', 'But at the start of 2018, both studies found, the writing changed conspicuously. Where the 2017 posts were filled with Socratic questions, the later posts were more declarative and expository, with heavy use of exclamation points and words written in all capital letters. Sometimes, Q shared internet memes.', 'The Q messages had recently jumped from an older message board to the one run by Ron Watkins and owned by his father, Jim — the site known then as 8chan and now as 8kun. Jim Watkins, a former U.S. Army helicopter repairman who had settled in the Philippines, also owned pig and honey farms and dabbled in the online pornography business. Around the 2016 election, he had created a conspiracy-minded pro-Trump website, with his son overseeing the technical side.', 'The evident change in writing style at the start of 2018 coincided with an unusual exchange between the Q account and Ron Watkins. After a period of confusion, whoever was writing as Q publicly asked Mr. Watkins to confirm that the messages were still coming from the original Q. Mr. Watkins immediately did, and then Q declared all future posts would appear exclusively on Mr. Watkins’s platform.', 'Mr. Furber began complaining that Q had been “hijacked” and that Mr. Watkins was complicit.', 'From then on, the scientists said, the messages very closely matched the writing of Ron Watkins alone. “When QAnon started to be successful, one of them took control,” said Mr. Roten of OrphAnalytics.', 'In a podcast interview in 2020, Fredrick Brennan, who started the message board that the Watkinses now own, asserted without proof that Q was the invention of Mr. Furber. An HBO documentary released last year, “Q: Into the Storm,” built a case that Ron Watkins was behind the messages, and in it Mr. Watkins briefly seemed to admit that he had written as Q. He then smiled, laughed and resumed his denials.', 'Q has now gone silent, without posting a message since December 2020.', 'Mr. Furber, in an interview, said he believed that QAnon was “an operation that has run its course.” He said he was still convinced that it was orchestrated by a true insider “to awaken people to this massive secret war against the cabal,” and that “the next phase is coming.”', 'In an online memoir he posted about the QAnon movement, he writes wistfully about the early days before “the hijacking.” Q’s messages, he says, seemed to validate conspiracy theories he had subscribed to for years — tying the Clintons and George Soros to the Rothschilds and the Illuminati.', '“Like a child being taken around his father’s workshop for the first time,” Mr. Furber writes, “we were being given a behind-the-scenes look into the ugly and corrupt world of geopolitics.”', 'Audio produced by Adrienne Hurst.', 'Produced by Gabriel Gianordoli.']","['message', 'Furber', 'Watkins', 'scientist', 'writing', 'QAnon', 'team', 'text', 'software', 'post', 'Ron', 'tweet', 'interview', 'study', 'question', 'analysis', 'medium', 'pattern', 'author', 'form']",images/146.png

Then, as activists bypassed those curbs with software that masked their locations, the authorities shut down almost all connectivity in the country.', 'The moves added uncertainty to an already dire situation. After payment apps and point-of-sale machines used to swipe debit cards went down, lengthy lines formed at A.T.M.s as Kazakhs rushed to get cash. Families could not communicate with loved ones. Taxi drivers who relied on ride-hailing apps said they stopped driving because they could not connect with passengers.', '“It was impossible to communicate,” said Darkhan Sharipov, 32, an accountant who was part of the protests. “The lack of information multiplied the chaos and disinformation.”', 'The scenes in Kazakhstan offer a preview of what may unfold in Ukraine, where the internet could be one of the first targets of the Russian military in a potential conflict. Ukrainian and Western officials have warned that cyberassaults could be part of any Russian intrusion.', 'While internet traffic in the country normally ebbs and flows each day, officials brought it to a near halt for many hours from Jan. 5  to 10.', 'Note: Traffic is indexed by normalizing bits transferred per second over the time period shown.', 'Source: Kentik', 'By The New York Times', 'This week, the Ukrainian government said the websites of two banks, its Ministry of Defense and its armed forces had been briefly taken offline by a series of denial-of-service attacks, in which huge amounts of traffic overwhelm a network. The attacks were the largest in the country’s history, Ukrainian officials said, and “bore traces of foreign intelligence services.”', 'On Thursday, internet service outages were recorded on some mobile networks in eastern Ukraine near the Russian border. Western officials said on Friday that they believed Russia was responsible for the cyberattacks on Ukrainian banks this week.', '“In the event of a real military conflict, it is the internet infrastructure that will be destroyed in the first place,” said Mikhail Klimarev, a Russia telecommunications expert and the executive director of the Internet Protection Society, a civil society group opposed to internet censorship.', '“In Kazakhstan, the internet was turned off by order of the authorities,” he said. “In Ukraine, we fear that the internet will be disabled by shelling.”', 'Control of the internet is increasingly part of any modern conflict. Recognizing that the web is vital for communications, economics and propaganda, authorities have used shutdowns more and more to stifle dissent and maintain power, in what is akin to holding energy sources, water or supply lines hostage.', 'In 2020, there were at least 155 internet shutdowns across 29 countries, according to the latest annual report from Access Now, an international nonprofit group that monitors these events. From January to May 2021, at least 50 shutdowns were documented in 21 countries.', 'They included in Yemen, where Saudi-led forces targeted the country’s telecom and internet infrastructure in the war there, according to Access Now. In November, Sudan’s leaders turned off the internet for nearly a month in response to protests. And in Burkina Faso, the government ordered telecom companies to turn off mobile internet networks for more than a week in November, citing national security concerns.', '“The only way to be absolutely sure that nobody is getting online is to pull the plug on everything,” said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis for Kentik, a telecom services company.', 'In Ukraine, any internet shutdown would have to be done by an outside force, which is different from the case in Kazakhstan, where the government used national security laws to force companies to cut off connections.', 'Taking down the Ukrainian internet completely would be cumbersome. The country has more than 2,000 internet service providers, all of which would need to be blocked for a full shutdown.', 'Max Tulyev, the owner of NetAssist, a small internet service provider in Ukraine, said his company had made preparations. To keep service going during a conflict, NetAssist has established links to other internet network operators and tried to route connections around common locations that could be attractive military targets, he said. It has also set up a backup network center and purchased satellite phones so employees can communicate if networks go down.', '“As Ukraine is well integrated into the internet, with a lot of different physical and logical links, it will be very hard to disconnect it completely,” said Mr. Tulyev, who is on the board of the Ukrainian Internet Association.', 'Still, many expect targeted blackouts, particularly in Russian-Ukrainian border areas, if there is war. Cyberattacks or a military attack could kill connectivity.', 'On Thursday evening, as fighting flared in eastern Ukraine near the front line with Russia-backed separatists, cellphone service went down in what authorities said was “targeted sabotage.” It was restored by Friday morning.', '“Sabotage of communications facilities will continue,” said Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian minister of internal affairs. “All this is part of Russia’s plan to destabilize the situation in Ukraine.”', 'In many countries, turning off the internet completely is not technically difficult. Regulators simply issue an order to telecom companies, telling them to shut off access or risk losing their license.', 'In Kazakhstan, the events last month illustrate how an internet shutdown can exacerbate a chaotic situation. The technical roots of the shutdown go back to at least 2015, when the country tried to emulate its neighbors China and Russia, which have for years practiced internet censorship. Authorities in those countries have developed methods for snooping on communications and built armies of hackers and trolls that can target opponents.', 'Last year, Russia slowed Twitter traffic during protests related to the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, a delay that has continued. China has built an arm of the police to arrest those who speak out online and commands thousands of volunteers who post positive comments to cheer on government initiatives.', 'The Kazakh authorities tried developing similar technical tools for surveillance and censorship without severing the key connections necessary for its economy to function, according to civil society groups and activists.', 'Last month, Kazakhstan plunged into disarray as anger over rising fuel prices grew into broad demonstrations, leading to a Russian-led military intervention. As the government cracked down, the protests turned violent. Dozens of antigovernment demonstrators were killed, and hundreds more were injured.', 'To prevent protesters from communicating and sharing information, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Kazakhstan’s president, turned to a digital scorched-earth policy akin to one in Myanmar last year that took the entire internet offline. In Myanmar, the military staged a coup, and soldiers took over the data centers run by the country’s telecom companies.', 'In Myanmar and Kazakhstan, the lack of internet heightened the confusion. In the event of a conflict in Ukraine, that added confusion would be a part of the point, Mr. Klimarev said.', '“Destroy the internet of your enemy, and it will be disorganized,” he said. “Banks, supply systems and logistics, transport and navigation will stop working.”', 'In Kazakhstan, the internet shutdowns began around Jan. 2 and lasted until Jan. 10. At first, they were limited to certain communications and targeted at areas where there were protests, said Arsen Aubakirov, a digital rights expert in Kazakhstan.', 'By Jan. 5, internet monitors said the country had gone almost completely offline, battering the country’s economy, including its sizable cryptocurrency operations.', 'The Ministry of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry ordered telecom operators to block access, citing a law that allowed the government to suspend networks and communication services in the interest of “ensuring antiterrorist and public security.”', 'While activists found some ways to circumvent the blocks, the lack of internet meant many demonstrators did not know when the government imposed new curfews, leading to violent clashes with the police, said Mr. Sharipov, who was detained by the authorities for protesting. While the internet was down, state-run media labeled the demonstrators “terrorists” and drug users.', '“This is another example of a country in turmoil opting to shut the internet down to buy them a few hours of lack of public or international scrutiny,” Mr. Madory said.']","['internet', 'country', 'Kazakhstan', 'service', 'Ukraine', 'government', 'network', 'shutdown', 'authority', 'Russia', 'protest', 'company', 'telecom', 'communication', 'conflict', 'official', 'month', 'traffic', 'event', 'lack']",images/147.png

Athletes and foreign journalists praise the polite volunteers and marvel at the high-speed trains and the robots that boil dumplings and mix drinks.', 'While China’s control of what its domestic viewers and readers consume is well established, the country has spread its own version of the Games beyond its borders, with an arsenal of digital tools that are giving China’s narrative arguably greater reach and more subtlety than ever before.', 'With bots, fake accounts, genuine influencers and other tools, China has been able to selectively edit how the events have appeared, even outside the country, promoting everything that bolsters the official, feel-good story about the Winter Olympics and trying to smother whatever doesn’t.', '“For the Chinese Communist Party, the Winter Olympics are inseparable from the broader political goal of building up the country’s national image,” said David Bandurski, director of the China Media Project, a monitoring organization. Referring to the country’s leader, he added: “This is what Xi Jinping has called ‘telling China’s story well.’”', 'On Twitter, which is banned in China, Chinese state media outlets and journalists, as well as diplomats, have tried to buff the image of the Games, raving about venues and cooing over the Olympic mascot.', 'China has also sought to influence online discussions in more concealed ways. The New York Times and ProPublica identified a network of more than 3,000 inauthentic-looking Twitter accounts that appeared to be coordinating to promote the Olympics by sharing state media posts with identical comments, for instance. Such accounts tended to be recently created with very few followers, tweeted mostly reposts and nothing of their own, and appeared to operate solely to amplify official Chinese voices.', 'Some of their efforts have centered on an account called Spicy Panda, which has been posting cartoons and videos to push back against calls for a boycott of the Olympics. In one cartoon, Spicy Panda accused the United States of wielding “its deceiving propaganda weapon to stain the Olympics.”', 'The tweet was reposted 281 times, all by the fake-looking accounts, but received little other engagement, a strong indication that the network was mobilized to promote the message. Aside from the bursts of promotion, Spicy Panda’s posts about the Olympics received almost no attention.', 'An analysis of Spicy Panda’s supporters turned up 861 accounts — 90 percent of which were created after Dec. 1. The accounts’ first wave of coordinated posts pushed Beijing’s stance that Hong Kong’s legislative council elections were legitimate, though critics have called the vote a sham. Then the accounts turned their attention to the Olympics. (By Thursday, all but one of the accounts had been suspended, shortly after The Times and ProPublica asked Twitter about them.)', 'Spicy Panda appears to have a connection with iChongqing, a state media-linked multimedia platform based in Chongqing, a city in central China. The accounts that shared Spicy Panda’s posts often did the same with tweets by iChongqing’s account. IChongqing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'Other botlike accounts promoted hashtags that seemed aimed at drowning out criticism of China, a hallmark of previous campaigns.', 'They promoted content under hashtags like #Beijing2022 and #TogetherForASharedFuture, this year’s official Olympic motto. Some accounts repeatedly posted tweets with identical wording, such as: “China’s hosting of the #Beijing2022 as scheduled has boosted the world’s confidence in defeating the pandemic.”', 'Twitter said in an emailed statement that it had suspended hundreds of the accounts identified by The Times and ProPublica for violations of its platform manipulation and spam policies. It said it was continuing to investigate the accounts’ links to state-backed information operations.', 'Even the Games’ official mascot, Bing Dwen Dwen, a cuddly panda in a suit of ice, has been the subject of an organized campaign on Twitter, according to Albert Zhang, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s International Cyber Policy Center.', 'Thousands of new or previously inactive accounts have helped the mascot go viral, he said — which China’s state media presented as evidence of the mascot’s popularity and, by extension, that of the Games.', '“If you want to push out a lot of content on something like the Beijing Olympics, this is an easy way to do it,” Mr. Zhang said. He added that the campaign now underway was like others sponsored by the Chinese state to push Beijing’s narrative on topics such as Covid-19 and the crackdown on Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.', 'The information space inside China is not unlike the elaborate measures that have created the “closed loop” that keeps athletes, journalists and other participants strictly segregated from the general public.', 'Inside the “closed loop” of official propaganda, the state carefully curates almost anything ordinary Chinese people see or read. The effect has been an Olympics free of scandal or criticism or bad news.', 'When the United States men’s hockey team played an overmatched Chinese team, the game was not shown on the main state television sports channel, CCTV 5, and the 8-0 defeat was mentioned only glancingly in news reports. A state media slide show devoted to the men’s figure skating competition conspicuously omitted the gold medalist, Nathan Chen of the United States.', 'In Chinese footage of the Games, the mountains where many competitions are being held have been deftly framed to exclude the dry, brown slopes in the background, until Day 8 when a snowstorm covered them in a frosting of white.', 'One of the biggest political stories of these Games has also unfolded outside China’s internet firewall: the appearance of Peng Shuai, the professional tennis player and three-time Olympian who created a furor when she accused a senior Communist Party leader of sexually assaulting her.', 'The president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, met her for dinner, as he promised he would when the global outcry over her fate threatened to overshadow the Games. Ms. Peng has appeared at curling and figure skating, among other events. None of that was shown inside China, where all references to her accusations have been erased, including later statements attributed to her, saying she had been misunderstood.', '“It’s absolutely critical to understand that this is not just another narrative,” Mr. Bandurski of the China Media Project said of the Olympics. “It’s a narrative that implies widespread censorship and the manipulation of public opinion, which is actually policy.”', 'Jack Stubbs, vice president of intelligence at Graphika, a social media monitoring company, said his firm had observed another Chinese propaganda network using foreign social media platforms.', 'The network has spread videos emphasizing the Olympics as environmentally friendly and crooning about strengthening Chinese-Russian ties, punctuated by President Vladimir V.

Nearly 50 people were lured in by her pitch: an afternoon twirled away in unserious but very intentional movement. The goal, Trimbur said, was to attain the effervescence of children putting on a backyard dance show.', '“We’re equal, we’re 13, and we’re just going to do some silly choreography to show our parents before dinner,” she said. “That’s the vibe.”', 'To loosen inhibitions, Trimbur suggested some screaming. And hugging a stranger. Dancers — clad in everything from ballet slippers with ripped tights to Converse and kneepads — were instructed to run across the room, wail in one another’s faces, then embrace. I joined in: It felt great and powerful and properly ridiculous. The energy was equal parts eighth-grade gym class and righteous affirmation.', 'Then came the routine, to a synthy 1986 cover of “You Keep Me Hangin’ On.” “I don’t do counts,” Trimbur said, directing us to slap our bottoms, roll on the ground, switch-kick, punch and spin. Her references were less Balanchine and more “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective” — she choreographs for faces, too. “F.Y.I. flailing about wildly IS dancing,” she wrote in her newsletter.', 'The kind of intuitive movement Trimbur champions, low-stakes and accessible, found a new audience during the pandemic, as dancers and dance teachers migrated online. Ryan Heffington — the pop choreographer whose Los Angeles studio, the Sweat Spot, helped a “come one, come all” dance culture blossom there — had tens of thousands of followers (Trimbur among them) in his Instagram Live sessions during early lockdown. Even eminences like Debbie Allen two-stepped for the feed, finding an unexpected communion, though everyone was literally dancing on their own.', 'Among this blossoming crop of teachers and influencers, and the legions of creators making their moves into memes on TikTok, Trimbur, 40, stands out. Underpinned by an intimate, self-revealing aesthetic, she fluidly navigates from sweaty group class to phone screen to ambitious project — dance is her public palliative for physical and emotional upheaval. And yet, she makes it fun.', ""“With her, it’s really the endorphins, the feeling that you’re in love, kind of, that she can generate,” said the filmmaker Miranda July, a friend and collaborator. Evan Rachel Wood, another friend and creative partner, trusts her implicitly: “I would privately make my own dance videos and edit them and play around,” she said, “but I would never show anybody — except Angela, because that's the energy that Angela brings. It’s about authenticity.”"", 'A short, lavish-looking dance film, “Unauthorized,” that Trimbur choreographed and Wood directed, yet to be released, is set to songs from Fiona Apple’s 2020 album “Fetch the Bolt Cutters.” In solos and with other artists, some traditional dance stars and some not, Trimbur leads in scenes across the Los Angeles cityscape and its dusty barrens. It starts off moving with sweet musical precision and turns into something more wild, womanly and beautiful, needling into male-female power dynamics and rebirth. Wood and Trimbur made it as a way to cope with the pandemic and other struggles, they said.', 'Trimbur’s work is full of empathy for people who, like her, are striving, July said. “All they have is their own bodies, which don’t work perfectly and might be failing them in a million different ways, and still they’re alive, and she’s alive, and that’s what the dance is about — that’s all right there with her.”', 'That she unspools all her ups and downs on Instagram has endeared her to almost 100,000 followers. In the pandemic-born social-media dance boom, even established artists found new footing. Though Heffington is commercially successful and spent a decade growing Sweat Spot (it closed during the pandemic), he said the overwhelming, global response to SweatFest, his Instagram series, changed his life. It redefined for him what was possible in ridding dance of its intimidation factor, pivoting it away from perfection and helping his followers find the joy. (It also raised substantial money for charity.)', '“It’s not about how high you kick, your flexibility — none of these traditional rules or metrics matter, in this new wave of thinking and including people,” Heffington, who planned to quietly start teaching in person again this month, said in a phone interview. “It’s just because you want to do it; that’s enough. Let’s lower the bar — let’s bury that bar — and allow everyone to come and just participate.”', 'In Los Angeles, where she lived until late last year, Trimbur had built a reputation as a community dance maven, hosting “Slightly Guided Dance Parties” at the Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art, and conjuring viral dance videos even pre-TikTok. (She’s also an actress, most recently playing a roller-skating influencer on “Search Party,” the HBO Max dark comedy.) She created and for six years led a women’s dance squad that performed at local basketball games and inspired fierce devotion among its fans and members.', 'That crew and other friends enveloped her when, in 2018, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy, and then six reconstruction and related surgeries. She documented her treatment online, becoming an advocate for other cancer patients, and setting up a support network through the video-messaging app Marco Polo (about 500 people joined, she said).', 'During the pandemic, the dance squad dissolved. And after a “Search Party” shoot last summer made Trimbur fall in love with Brooklyn — “I’ve never felt this alive, you know? New York is magical” — she packed up 15 years of her West Coast life and her two pet cockatiels, and moved. Now she is reigniting her career here, from a Bushwick loft that she is decorating in high gloss black-and-white to resemble an ’80s nightclub. There are multiple disco balls, 1981 Vogue magazines fanned out atop a panther coffee table, and a boxy white TV/VCR that had been in her childhood bedroom. When I met her at home for an interview, she popped in a VHS of “Dirty Dancing.”', 'She choreographs in the studio-style mirrors she had installed, and teaches a Zoom dance-fitness class — lately called “apathetic aerobics,” for when you can’t manage the regular high-pitched workout zeal. (It’s set to emo.)', 'Trimbur is also developing a TV show about her life for a cable network, she said, with July as a producer. They met when July cast her as a YouTube dancer in her 2011 film “The Future”; later, they discovered a mutual affinity for estate sales, and started surreptitiously recording improvised scenes there.', '“She’s a really special combination of innocent and blunt,” July said. “Sometimes she’ll say something and I’ll just want to write it down, because it’s perfectly put, but not the therapy version of it, which is sort of rare these days.”', 'Trimbur grew up outside Philadelphia, where her mother ran a dance studio — “When she picked up the phone, it would be like, ‘Pitter Patter Dance Studio, where everyone’s a star!’” Trimbur and her sister, Colleen, were its exemplary pupils, learning all the routines. But when Trimbur was around 12, her mother became a Jehovah’s Witness, closed the studio and pulled her children out of school. Trimbur’s formal dance education largely ended then, but she spent hours at home, filming herself dancing — just as she does now.', '“The way that I like to think about dance is the version of myself that’s, like, stuck inside in my living room, just dancing to Mariah Carey,” she said. “That’s what brings me joy, to just be free and not think about what’s the right step.” Still, New York’s multifaceted dance scene brings new possibilities, and Trimbur is already envisioning taking Broadway-style classes and staging adult recitals at school auditoriums. (A Valentine’s Day couples dance event she organized for the Bell House in Brooklyn quickly sold out.)', 'Dancing through and after cancer has been its own revelation. Hosting the “Slightly Guided Dance Parties” during chemo, she sometimes had to step offstage to regain her energy, she said, but she didn’t regret the gig. Dancing, she said, “is the way that I talk to myself.” She and Wood made the Fiona Apple short just before she got her breast implants removed; as a dancer, Trimbur said, “they just felt like stapled Tupperware.” As part of treatment, she also had her ovaries removed, so the film is an emotional memento, one of her last instances of performing with her old body.', '“It was palpable watching Angela dance — I fully understood that that is how she processes things,” Wood said.', 'Trimbur begins her in-person classes with students in a fetal position for a womb-like meditation, followed by a close listen of, say, Christina Aguilera’s “Beautiful.” It’s not uncommon for people to cry, she said.', 'She wants to unlock them from those emotions when they begin to wiggle up: “Get weirder, girls, get weirder!” she extolled, in the class I attended.', 'In another class, she instructed, “there’s a part in the song where you’re going to throw yourself on the floor like a toddler” having a tantrum — “but the face is cute.”', '“I want to be able to just make people laugh through dance without it being too, like, honk, honk,” she told me, mimicking a schlocky comedian with an airhorn. There was a sense of gleeful abandon in that Manhattan studio — I’ve rarely seen so many students smiling in between reps — as the shrieks mixed with giggles.', 'Her New York dancers are already hooked. “It’s like church,” said Chelsy Mitchell, 32, a dance newbie who has been coming weekly since Trimbur started her Sunday classes, traveling an hour-and-a-half one way from her home upstate. “Dance therapy.”', 'Catherine McCafferty, a 20-something comedian and actor, had the weight of 18 years of ballet and other dance training when she stepped into Trimbur’s studio for the first time that afternoon. She’d come because she liked what she saw on Instagram, but she was also new to New York and nervous that she wouldn’t measure up. Instead of feeling judged, she felt released. “The only eyes that are on you are a bunch of other people who want you to shine,” she said.', 'For Trimbur, that atmosphere of validation is paramount. “I get so frustrated when somebody says something like, ‘I can’t dance,’ or they say, ‘I’m the worst one’ or ‘no one wants to see me do that,’” she said. “It’s so sad because I know, scientifically, how happy you could be, if you gave yourself permission to move.”']","['Trimbur', 'dance', 'class', 'studio', 'people', 'dancer', 'way', 'Wood', 'York', 'New', 'year', 'phone', 'friend', 'video', 'film', 'scene', 'Dance', 'Instagram', 'life', 'Angeles']",images/149.png

She and other musicians also used the episode to reiterate long-running complaints that the streaming economy does not pay artists enough.', 'As the controversy swirled, many Spotify workers felt management was too slow to respond, two current employees said. It also raised alarms on Spotify’s board of directors, where some members have been disappointed by the company’s halting response, according to a person familiar with the events who asked to remain anonymous because of confidentiality agreements.', 'Management of the crisis in the United States may have been further complicated because Spotify’s headquarters is nearly 4,000 miles away, in Sweden, where Mr. Ek, a publicity-shy executive who grew up in a suburb of Stockholm, and many of the company’s engineers and longest-tenured employees are based.

Management’s position, however, was clear: Mr. Rogan wasn’t going anywhere.', 'As the months wore on and Mr. Rogan showed no sign of shying away from controversy, more people connected to the company began to speak out against his presence on the platform.', 'In January, after 270 scientists, medical professionals and others wrote to Spotify to raise alarms about Covid-related misinformation on Mr. Rogan’s show, executives made assurances internally that the company was taking the issue seriously and that it was continuing to review Mr. Rogan’s shows to make sure they were complying with Spotify’s rules, said a person involved in the discussions.', 'The issue exploded on Jan. 24, when Mr. Young, the rock icon, posted a public letter demanding that his music be removed from Spotify over coronavirus misinformation. “They can have Rogan or Young,” he wrote. “Not both.”', 'Joni Mitchell followed him off the platform, and within days, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who have their own deal to produce podcasts for Spotify but have produced only one, voiced their own concerns about Covid misinformation on the platform.', 'Amid the backlash, Mr. Rogan promised to add “balance” to the conversations on his show. But days later, the crisis widened when the R&B singer India.Arie posted a video compilation of Mr. Rogan repeatedly using a racial slur, and said she wished to withdraw her music as well. She and other musicians also used the episode to reiterate long-running complaints that the streaming economy does not pay artists enough.', 'As the controversy swirled, many Spotify workers felt management was too slow to respond, two current employees said. It also raised alarms on Spotify’s board of directors, where some members have been disappointed by the company’s halting response, according to a person familiar with the events who asked to remain anonymous because of confidentiality agreements.', 'Management of the crisis in the United States may have been further complicated because Spotify’s headquarters is nearly 4,000 miles away, in Sweden, where Mr. Ek, a publicity-shy executive who grew up in a suburb of Stockholm, and many of the company’s engineers and longest-tenured employees are based. ', 'Free expression is a deeply held belief in Sweden. Many employees there — and in the United States — were angry when Spotify removed music by R. Kelly and XXXTentacion from playlists in 2018 for content or conduct deemed offensive, a decision the company quickly reversed.', 'Mr. Ek has made it clear that he is wary of taking on the role of censor. “We’re not in the business of dictating the discourse that these creators want to have on their shows,” he told employees earlier this month in a speech first reported by The Verge, adding that “if we only wanted to make content that we all like and agree with, we will need to eliminate religion, and politics, and comedy, and health, and environment, and education, the list goes on and on and on.”', 'And as a business matter, censoring Mr. Rogan could alienate his legion of fans and set a slippery precedent with other podcasters, according to Mark Mulligan, an industry analyst with Midia Research.', '“That could put at risk their future podcast strategy,” Mr. Mulligan said.', 'In a recent memo to employees, Mr. Ek wrote that “canceling voices is a slippery slope” but acknowledged that a number of episodes of Mr. Rogan’s show had been removed from the platform. He wrote that Mr. Rogan had decided to remove them after meetings with Spotify executives and “his own reflections.”', 'Katherine Rosman and Ben Sisario reported from New York, Mike Isaac reported from Oakland, Calif., and Adam Satariano reported from London.

The agency said that covers about 416,000 cars. The preliminary inquiry is intended to determine the scope and severity of the problem.', 'The complaints claim that the vehicle “unexpectedly applies its brakes while driving at highway speeds,” the safety agency wrote in a summary of the investigation. “Complainants report that the rapid deceleration can occur without warning, at random, and often repeatedly.”', 'Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.', 'The investigation is the latest safety concern that Tesla has been confronted with. Separately this year, Tesla recalled 54,000 cars equipped with its Full Self-Driving software to disable a feature that in certain conditions let the vehicles roll slowly through intersections without stopping. Failing to stop at a stop sign can increase the risk of a crash, the safety agency told Tesla in a letter.', 'The agency also opened a formal investigation last year into Autopilot and how it identifies objects and other vehicles on the road. That inquiry was prompted by 11 incidents in which Teslas operating in Autopilot failed to stop for and crashed into police cars, fire trucks and other emergency vehicles that had flashing lights turned on.', 'In the last few months, Tesla recalled 12,000 cars to correct a braking problem and recalled 458,000 others for two separate mechanical defects. It also agreed to turn off a feature that allowed drivers or front passengers to play video games on the dashboard touch-screen while car were in motion. The problem had been highlighted in The New York Times, and the safety agency pressed the company to address it.']","['car', 'agency', 'safety', 'investigation', 'vehicle', 'Tesla', 'problem', 'braking', 'complaint', 'feature', 'road', 'year', 'company', 'brake', 'inquiry', 'driver', 'month', 'States', 'United', 'sedan']",images/154.png

They imagine controlling both popular programming like Rogan’s show and the digital spot where we listen.', 'This comes at a time when tech nerds want to remodel the internet to be less dictated by powerful companies — captured by the umbrella term “Web3.” That reality already existed in podcasts, and is fading.

There isn’t a set of rules that everyone has to follow.', 'Maybe that doesn’t seem remarkable, but it kind of is. In much of the internet, Big Tech bouncers man the doors.', 'Apple and (to a lesser extent) Google dictate where we download apps, how we pay for them and what features they include.

The places where we form communities online are often controlled by superpowers like Facebook.', 'The biggest chunk of people who listen to podcasts use the audio app that comes standard with iPhones, but Apple hasn’t gotten nearly as involved in podcasts as it has in apps. Podcasts were for awhile an unruly but glorious free for all.', 'There was no single moment when podcasting started to become more like an exclusive nightclub.

Podcasts, especially popular ones that people can find only on Spotify, might be the company’s ticket to enduring financial success. Nearly 30 percent of Americans listen to podcasts each week, and audiences and advertising sales are growing fast. Podcasts have become a cultural force. That is a delicious target for companies.', 'Powerful companies taking more control over podcasts has its benefits. It’s easier to find stuff you might like because Amazon, Spotify or YouTube might suggest options for you to discover. Spotify has clever podcast ideas that take advantage of its mix of music and podcasts, including shows that combine songs with host banter similar to radio DJ morning shows.', 'But it’s also a bummer that podcasts are being tamed.

But just to be safe, he contacted a lawyer, James Scarmozzino, to represent him. Mr. Scarmozzino connected the family to other lawyers who organized a business centered on Ava’s potential earnings.', 'Michael Marino, an entertainment lawyer in New York, created an enterprise, AGM Creations, for Ava, and signed an agreement with the Majurys for a percentage of future revenues. Mr. Marino turned to a friend, Lanny Davis, a Washington lawyer and crisis manager whose public relations firm is now representing Ava.', 'The shooting continues to reverberate.', 'The boy who received Mr. Justin’s messages about his plans to attack Ava still attends high school with her. In December, Ava told her parents that he was following and watching her. The family visited the high school to report the matter. Last month, another classmate sent her a video the boy had made of himself firing a gun at a shooting range, her mother said.', 'Unnerved, Ava withdrew from school this month and now attends class from home. Mr. Scarmozzino filed a petition in Collier County Circuit Court seeking an injunction for protection against stalking. A hearing is set for Feb. 28, and Ava will testify.', 'Ava is still on social media, with her parents’ support. Mrs. Majury said she did not want “sick individuals” to force Ava off the platforms. “Why should we allow them to stop her? Maybe she’s meant to bring awareness to all this,” Mrs. Majury said.', 'Ava has not told her followers what happened. “I don’t want it to go out negatively and people think I attracted him,” she said.', 'Her greater worry is that other troubled people will “make it a contest to see who can get here first,’’ and she acknowledged that sometimes at night, trying to fall asleep after the shooting, “I’d think, ‘I don’t want to do this anymore.’” But by morning, “I thought of all the benefits.’’', '“Most people would say the money. And yeah, it’s a huge benefit. But it’s the experience.

', 'A TikTok spokeswoman, Mahsau Cullinane, emailed a statement saying that TikTok is “deeply invested in the safety and well-being of our community’’ and added that the platform uses tools to protect users under the age of 16. In 2020, TikTok classified more than a third of its 49 million daily users in the United States as 14 or younger, according to internal company data and documents reviewed by The Times.', 'Ava has two brothers, Evan and Logan, ages 17 and 11. She and Evan attend a sprawling public high school where much of student life revolves around social media. ', 'In early 2020, after Ava noticed Mr. Justin angling for her attention on TikTok, she learned that friends in New Jersey and Florida were selling him photos of her as well as her personal information, including her cellphone number, which Mr. Justin used to call and text her. In another instance, Mr. Justin logged onto a classmate’s school account and did math homework in exchange for information about Ava, her family said.', '“I had to unfollow all my local friends and Jersey friends,” Ava said. “And everyone around me was like, ‘Oh you’re going Hollywood on all of us, you don’t want to talk to us anymore.’ And I’m like, ‘You’re selling my stuff.’”', 'But Ava’s parents allowed her to sell Mr. Justin a couple of selfies that she had already posted to Snapchat.', '“I wasn’t sending anything of my body,’’ Ava said. “It was just pictures of my face, which is what I assume that he was paying for. My whole thing is my pretty smile — that’s my content.” She said Mr. Justin paid about $300 for two photos, via the Venmo digital wallet app.', 'After that, Mr. Justin messaged Ava on Venmo with a breakdown of what he would pay for “booty pics” and photos of her feet, “stuff that a 14-year-old shouldn’t be sending,” she said. She blocked him on all her accounts. In Venmo messages viewed by The Times, Mr. Justin pleaded with her to unblock him, sending $159.18, then $100, and finally $368.50 with the message, “sorry this is all I have left i’m broke.”', 'Mr. Majury said he texted Mr. Justin’s cellphone, told him that Ava was a minor, and demanded that he stop contacting her.', 'At that point Mr. Justin’s efforts turned sinister. In a series of text messages that made their way to Ava, and which the Majury family showed The Times, he asked one of Ava’s male classmates whether he had access to a “strap,” or gun, shared plans to assault her, and wrote, “i could just breach the door with a shotgun i think.” The classmate’s mother declined an interview request.', 'When Ava learned of the threatening messages, she called the classmate who had received them. He confirmed that he had gotten them, and forwarded others to her. Fearful, she showed her parents. They researched Mr. Justin’s identity, saw that he lived hundreds of miles away, and reassured her that “he was one of these keyboard cowboys,” Mr. Majury said. ', '“I sort of discredited what could have been a threat.”', 'Ava’s bedroom was just inside the door Mr. Justin blasted open.', '“All I remember was, I heard it, I felt it in my chest, and I looked up, and there was a hole in my door from the fragments,” she said. She ran through a connecting bathroom to her brothers’ room, clutching a blanket, water bottle and her cellphone.', 'Mr. Majury bolted from bed and ran shouting to the foyer, where he said debris still floated in the air. Mrs. Majury followed, dialing 911 on her phone. Outside a gangly teenager wearing what looked like a blue Walmart worker’s vest, protective earplugs and safety glasses stood on the front lawn. He turned to escape and Mr. Majury sprinted forward but fell, gashing his knee. The gunman paused, struggling to clear his jammed weapon, then ran away. Mr. Majury retrieved his handgun, and was standing at the front door awaiting the police when Mr. Justin returned. Mr. Majury said he ordered the teenager to drop the shotgun, and when he instead pointed it at him, Mr. Majury fired.', 'The three Majury children had retreated to their parents’ bedroom in the rear of the house. Ava’s older brother, Evan, turned to her in panic and fury.', '“This is all your fault,” he said.', '“The subject was most likely a stalker that resulted from her daughter’s extensive social media involvement,” the Collier County Sheriff’s Office report read, citing statements to them from Mrs. Majury. “Since her daughter’s involvement with social media, multiple subjects have attempted to ascertain her family’s address in the past.” Mrs. Majury provided them with contact information for Mr. Justin, the report said.', 'The Collier County Sheriff’s Office told local media at the time that a man had been shot and killed by the resident of a home in Raffia Preserve after firing a gun into the home, in an attempted home invasion robbery. The office did not name the gunman.', 'The Majurys said police told them that Mr. Justin was carrying two cellphones that contained thousands of photographs of Ava and hundreds of hours of her videos.', 'Collier County Sheriff Kevin Rambosk and investigators from his office did not respond to requests for interviews. “This remains an active investigation and there are no updates,” Karie Partington, a sheriff’s office spokeswoman, said in an email.', 'The gunman’s identity was confirmed by his father, Justin Dominic. Mr. Dominic, a software engineer who is divorced from Mr. Justin’s mother, said that before the divorce the family had lived in the United States and then had moved to Mr. Dominic’s native India. When his parents split up, Mr. Justin chose to move back to the U.S. with his mother, his father said, recalling their move as around 2015.', 'Mr. Dominic, who said he had spoken with investigators, recalled his son as a good student who did well in math at Mount Hebron High School in Ellicott City. “He was a nice kid. I’m at a loss for words,” he said in an interview. “I don’t know what went bad with him. He made a bad choice.”', 'After the shooting the Majurys, reeling, moved in with friends. A few days later Mrs. Majury received an invitation from a would-be agent for Ava to visit Los Angeles, meet other influencers, and attend a couple of red carpet events. One was for “Glo-Up Girls,” a line of makeover-ready dolls advertised on a YouTube channel featuring six teenage influencers “living in a mansion and taking on sensational Glo-Up challenges.”', '“It was a nice distraction, absolutely,” Mrs. Majury said.', 'After the Majurys returned home, their homeowners’ association sent a letter to their landlord demanding their eviction because, among other reasons, Ava’s social media venture had attracted an intruder to the property.', 'In early August, Ava received messages on Venmo from a man calling her “baby girl,” offering to pay $1,000 a month for her phone number. Her parents discovered that the man’s name matches that of a registered sex offender, arrested previously for soliciting a 14-year-old girl.', 'Mrs. Majury remembers thinking, “We can’t live like this.”', 'Mr. Majury said he was advised by the police that under Florida’s “stand your ground” law governing justifiable use of deadly force, he was not subject to prosecution. But just to be safe, he contacted a lawyer, James Scarmozzino, to represent him. Mr. Scarmozzino connected the family to other lawyers who organized a business centered on Ava’s potential earnings.', 'Michael Marino, an entertainment lawyer in New York, created an enterprise, AGM Creations, for Ava, and signed an agreement with the Majurys for a percentage of future revenues. Mr. Marino turned to a friend, Lanny Davis, a Washington lawyer and crisis manager whose public relations firm is now representing Ava.', 'The shooting continues to reverberate.', 'The boy who received Mr. Justin’s messages about his plans to attack Ava still attends high school with her. In December, Ava told her parents that he was following and watching her. The family visited the high school to report the matter. Last month, another classmate sent her a video the boy had made of himself firing a gun at a shooting range, her mother said.', 'Unnerved, Ava withdrew from school this month and now attends class from home. Mr. Scarmozzino filed a petition in Collier County Circuit Court seeking an injunction for protection against stalking. A hearing is set for Feb. 28, and Ava will testify.', 'Ava is still on social media, with her parents’ support. Mrs. Majury said she did not want “sick individuals” to force Ava off the platforms. “Why should we allow them to stop her? Maybe she’s meant to bring awareness to all this,” Mrs. Majury said.', 'Ava has not told her followers what happened. “I don’t want it to go out negatively and people think I attracted him,” she said.', 'Her greater worry is that other troubled people will “make it a contest to see who can get here first,’’ and she acknowledged that sometimes at night, trying to fall asleep after the shooting, “I’d think, ‘I don’t want to do this anymore.’” But by morning, “I thought of all the benefits.’’', '“Most people would say the money. And yeah, it’s a huge benefit. But it’s the experience. I got to go to L.A., the people that I met,” she said. “Just being able to make other people smile is what I like, the enjoyment of seeing the impact I made on some people’s lives.', '“I’d post a video at night, close my eyes, and in the morning it was exciting to see how many views I got.”', 'Her father interjected: “It’s like Christmas every day, because then you see it build.”', '“I think we just had to allow her to make a decision and sort of support her. I think it’s going to help her heal. It sounds corny, but I don’t know what else you would do it for.”', 'Kitty Bennett and Susan C.

Can It Make a Comeback?,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/technology/intel-ceo-patrick-gelsinger.html,"['Patrick Gelsinger was 18 years old and four months into an entry-level job at Intel when he heard a pivotal sermon at a Silicon Valley church in February 1980. There, a minister quoted Jesus from the Book of Revelation.', '“I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!” the minister said. “So, because you are lukewarm — neither hot nor cold — I am about to spit you out of my mouth.”', 'The words jolted Mr. Gelsinger, reshaping his philosophy. He realized he had been a lukewarm believer, one who practiced his faith just once a week. He vowed never to be neither hot nor cold again.', 'Now, at age 60, Mr. Gelsinger is hot about one thing in particular: Revitalizing Intel, a Silicon Valley icon that lost its leading position in chip manufacturing.', 'The 120,000-person company was a household name in the 1990s, celebrated as a fount of innovation as its microprocessors became the electronic brains in the vast majority of computers. But Intel failed to place its chips into smartphones, which became the device of choice for most people. Apple and Google instead grew into the trillion-dollar emblems of Silicon Valley.', 'Rejuvenating Intel is partly about Mr. Gelsinger’s own ambitions. As a young engineer, he once wrote down a goal of leading Intel one day. But in 2009, after spending his entire career at the company, he was forced out. A year ago, he was wooed back for a surprise second chance.', 'His mission is also about America’s place in the world. Mr. Gelsinger wants to return the United States to a leading role in semiconductor production, reducing the country’s dependence on manufacturers in Asia and easing a global chip shortage. Intel, he believes, can spearhead the charge. If he succeeds, the impact could extend far beyond computers to just about every device with an on-off switch.', 'The quest faces many obstacles. Steering a $200 billion company while chasing a goal of raising U.S. chip production to 30 percent globally from about 12 percent today requires tens of billions of dollars, political maneuvering with governments and years of patience.', '“You’re going to have to spend a lot of money and you’re going to have to spend it for a long period of time,” said Simon Segars, who recently stepped down as chief executive of Arm, a British company whose chip designs power most smartphones. “Whether governments have the stomach for that over the long term remains to be seen.”', 'In four interviews, Mr. Gelsinger acknowledged the difficulties. But the father of four and grandfather of eight has pursued the goals with intensity.', 'In March, he unveiled a $20 billion project to add two chip factories to Intel’s complex near Phoenix. Last month, he joined President Biden to showcase a $20 billion investment in a new chip manufacturing site near Columbus, Ohio. On Tuesday, he announced a $5.4 billion deal to buy Tower Semiconductor, which operates chip production services from factories in four countries.', 'To drum up government support for his investments, Mr. Gelsinger has attended three virtual White House gatherings, spoken with two dozen members of Congress and four governors. He became a key ally to President Biden over a $52 billion package that would provide grants to companies willing to set up new U.S. chip factories. And in Europe, Mr. Gelsinger met with President Emmanuel Macron of France, President Mario Draghi of Italy, their counterparts in other countries, and the pope.', 'It has been a tough slog. Intel’s stock has dropped as Mr. Gelsinger committed huge sums to chip manufacturing. The $52 billion funding package stalled for months in the House of Representatives, finally passing this month as part of broader legislation that must now be reconciled with a Senate version. Criticism of the chief executive from Wall Street analysts has ramped up.', '“Every day the job is way bigger than me,” Mr. Gelsinger said. But “it’s OK,” he added, because he believes he has help. “God, I need you showing up with me today because this job is way more than I could possibly do myself.”', 'If his father had managed to buy a farm, Mr. Gelsinger would almost certainly have inherited it and become a farmer. That was expected in Robesonia, a borough in Pennsylvania Dutch country where he was raised and worked on his uncles’ farms.', 'But there was no farm to inherit. So at age 16, Mr. Gelsinger passed a scholarship exam that took him to the Lincoln Technical Institute, a for-profit vocational school, where he earned an associate degree.', 'Mr. Gelsinger tells this and other stories self-deprecatingly in a 2003 book of advice that he wrote for Christians titled “Balancing Your Family, Faith & Work,” which was expanded in 2008 and titled, “The Juggling Act: Bringing Balance to Your Faith, Family, and Work.”', 'In 1979, he was interviewed at the technical institute by a manager from Intel. Unlike most of the other students there, Mr. Gelsinger had heard of the company. He breezed through questions related to his studies and predicted he could earn bachelor’s, master’s and Ph.D. degrees while holding down a full-time job, said Ronald Smith, the former Intel executive who conducted the interview.', '“He is very smart, very ambitious and arrogant,” Mr. Smith said he wrote in a summary of the conversation. “He’ll fit right in.”', 'Mr. Gelsinger took his first plane ride to interview at Intel in California, where he started in October 1979 as a technician. He worked on improving the reliability of microprocessors while studying for a bachelor’s degree at Santa Clara University.', 'He soon started hanging out with the engineers who designed the chips, coming up with ideas to test the chips more efficiently. In 1982, he became the fourth engineer on the team that introduced the groundbreaking 80386 microprocessor.', 'During a 1985 presentation near the completion of the chip, Mr. Gelsinger chided Intel’s leaders Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore and Andy Grove about balky company computers that were slowing the process.', 'A few days later, he got a surprise call from Mr. Grove. The Hungarian-born executive, then Intel’s president who later wrote the management book “Only the Paranoid Survive,” had built a culture where lower-level employees were encouraged to challenge superiors if they could back up their positions. Mr. Grove began mentoring Mr. Gelsinger, a relationship that lasted three decades.', 'By 1986, Mr. Grove had convinced Mr. Gelsinger not to pursue a doctorate at Stanford University and instead made him, at age 24, the leader of a 100-person team designing Intel’s 80486 microprocessor. Mr. Gelsinger eventually earned eight patents, became Intel’s youngest vice president in 1992 and the first person with the title of chief technology officer in 2001.', 'His climb up Intel’s ladder was shaped by another priority: his faith.', 'Though raised in the mainstream United Church of Christ, Mr. Gelsinger said he didn’t really become a Christian until he attended the nondenominational church in Silicon Valley where he met Linda Fortune, who later became his wife. It was at that church in 1980 that he heard the minister quote Revelations.', 'After Mr. Gelsinger became a born-again Christian, he wrestled privately with whether to join the clergy. In a 2019 oral history conducted by the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., he said he eventually decided to become a “workplace minister,” where “you really view yourself as working for God as your C.E.O., even though you’re working for Intel.”', 'In the mid-2000s, Mr. Gelsinger’s footing within Intel shifted. Mr. Grove retired as board chairman in 2004. Another executive, Paul Otellini, was appointed chief executive in 2005. Mr. Gelsinger said he was a “dissonant voice” on Intel’s senior executive team.', 'Mr. Otellini pushed him to leave, Mr. Gelsinger said. (Mr. Otellini died in 2017.) In 2009, Mr. Gelsinger accepted an offer to become president and chief operating officer of EMC, a maker of data storage gear.', 'Departing Intel after 30 years as a company man hurt badly. “I was just so angry and emotional about the departure,” Mr. Gelsinger said.', 'In 2012, he became chief executive of VMware, a software company that EMC controlled. He weathered challenges there, including an aborted effort to compete in cloud computing services with Amazon, but broadened the company’s business and nearly tripled revenues.', 'During those years, Intel slipped. For decades, the company had led the industry in delivering regular factory advances that pack more processing power into chips. But delays in perfecting new production processes allowed rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung Electronics to grab the lead in manufacturing technology between 2015 and 2019.', 'Today, T.S.M.C. makes chips designed by hundreds of other companies. It supplies the world with more than 90 percent of the chips made with the most advanced production technology. Because it is headquartered in Taiwan, which China has laid territorial claim to, its location has made it a political and supply chain chokepoint should conflict erupt over the island nation.', 'Intel was also suffering from its missteps in the mobile market, which consumes billions of processors compared with the hundreds of millions sold for computers.', 'After convincing Apple to use its chips in Macintosh computers in 2005, Intel had a chance to win a place in the iPhone, which debuted in 2007. But Mr. Otellini said in a 2013 interview in The Atlantic that he turned down the opportunity because the price that Apple was willing to pay for chips was too low to make a profit.', 'The decision, which Mr. Otellini said he regretted, led Apple to use rival Arm technology for smartphones and, later, tablets. So did Samsung and other companies that make devices using Google’s Android software. More recently, Apple started using Arm chips in many new Macs.', 'Mr. Otellini and his successors prioritized Intel’s profit margins while failing to take risks to move into new markets and outflank rivals, former company insiders now acknowledge. If boiled down to a book, “it could be called ‘the insufficiently paranoid don’t survive,’” said Reed Hundt, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman who served on Intel’s board from 2001 to 2020, in a nod to Mr. Grove’s “Only the Paranoid Survive.”', 'As questions swirled about Intel’s future, Mr. Gelsinger was viewed as a possible savior. But he insisted he was committed to VMware, a point he seemed to underscore by adding a temporary tattoo with the company’s name on his arm during a 2018 conference in Las Vegas.', 'Then, just before Thanksgiving 2020, an Intel director asked Mr. Gelsinger to join the company’s board. Mr. Gelsinger asked for permission from Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, which then controlled VMware.', '“I knew Intel needed some help and Pat was somebody who could help a lot, so I said ‘sure,’” Mr. Dell said.', 'In short supply. Around the world, industries are struggling\xa0because there are too few\xa0computer chips. Here is what to know:', 'A vital component. Computer chips, also known as semiconductors, are the brains of products like smartphones, cars, medical devices\xa0and most modern appliances. \u200b\u200bThe vast majority are made in Taiwan, South Korea and China.', 'How the shortage began. Computer chips started becoming scarce early in the pandemic, when\xa0chip buyers, in particular automakers,\xa0slashed their orders\xa0fearing a global recession. In response, semiconductor plants reduced\xa0their production.', 'An increase in demand. As the pandemic forced people to spend more time at home, global demand for products\xa0like desktop monitors and printers surged. By then it was too late for the chip industry to increase production quickly.', 'Ongoing struggles. Adding back chip-making capacity can require as much as two years of lead time and billions of dollars. Manufacturers\xa0have scrambled to fill orders from their largest customers, making things exceedingly difficult for smaller companies.', 'Troubles in the U.S. The Biden administration has warned that the U.S., which only accounts for 12 percent of global production, is facing “alarming” shortages\xa0that threaten\xa0American factory production and could fuel inflation.', 'In search of solutions. Democrats in Congress are\xa0hoping to revive\xa0a stalled bill\xa0that would prop up semiconductor makers by providing $52 billion in subsidies. Cities\xa0and companies like Intel\xa0and Ford\xa0also have taken steps to support local production.', 'At a dinner before Christmas, two Intel board members asked Mr. Gelsinger if he would think about the chief executive role instead. “That ruined my Christmas holiday,” he said.', 'He and his wife took long walks to discuss what to do. Early in their marriage, they had committed to giving an increasing percentage of their gross income to philanthropic causes such as schools in Kenya and Christian nonprofits, with the percentage reaching about 50 percent, he said in the oral history.', 'Their values came up during what he said were “three weeks of chaos” over the Intel job. The couple concluded that Intel’s size and influence would give Mr. Gelsinger a global platform to promote technology for good purposes, not to mention serving as a Christian role model.', '“The fact that I continue to be very public about my faith is seen more and more like a unicorn in the market,” he said. “I would hope to make it less so.”', 'Mr. Gelsinger already had ideas about how to turn around Intel. The company was rumored to be considering a spinoff of its manufacturing operations, but Mr. Gelsinger believed steady chip demand would leave companies with factories in a powerful position.', 'He drafted a plan to expand Intel’s manufacturing operations. He also wanted to emulate T.S.M.C. by making semiconductors for other companies and not just Intel’s own microprocessors. Becoming a major provider of these “foundry services” could also buffer America from future supply chain shocks.', 'In January 2021, at a virtual meeting with Intel’s board, Mr. Gelsinger insisted the nine directors unanimously endorse him and the manufacturing expansion strategy. They did. Mr. Gelsinger was offered an annual salary of $1.25 million and bonus of up to $3.4 million, plus one-time equity awards that could be worth up to $110 million if Intel’s share price reached certain long-term targets.', 'Mr. Gelsinger started work as Intel’s chief executive on Feb. 15, 2021.', 'Mr. Gelsinger had the job he had long dreamed of. But he took over during a full-blown chip crisis. The pandemic had disrupted production and unleashed new demand, as people working from home snapped up new computers and other devices. The chip shortage was so severe that some carmakers temporarily shut down their plants.', 'In Washington, where officials worried about the reliance on Asian chip suppliers, discussions about how to right the imbalance ramped up. The $52 billion package of incentives to boost domestic chip production, known as the CHIPS Act, passed the Senate in June with bipartisan support.', 'Last March, Mr. Gelsinger announced Intel’s manufacturing expansion, including the foundry plan and the $20 billion Arizona project. When he detailed the long-term financial impact in October, Wall Street was stunned. Intel shed nearly $25 billion in market value in one day. ', 'Critics have questioned whether Intel can catch up to T.S.M.C. and Samsung in manufacturing technology, while others have been skeptical of the foundry plan. Some big chip makers would be reluctant to pay a competitor for such manufacturing services, they said.', 'And while T.S.M.C. offers production processes that are tweaked to make many kinds of chips, Intel is known for rigidly standardizing its manufacturing to make microprocessors.', '“That is the opposite of the flexibility you need for the foundry business,” said Walden Rhines, who runs the chip start-up Cornami.', 'Mr. Gelsinger countered that Intel’s foundry business had attracted the Pentagon and Qualcomm, the big mobile chip maker, and said his long-term investments would eventually pay off. “We need to boldly seize this moment,” he said.', 'At the same time, Mr. Gelsinger courted government officials to bolster chip manufacturing in the United States and Europe.', 'In September, he showed up in Washington to lobby the House to approve the CHIPS Act. There, he met with a couple dozen members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of Democratic and Republican representatives, who had questions about the chip shortage and the proposed funding package.', 'Representative Haley Stevens, a Michigan Democrat who was at the meeting, said Mr. Gelsinger made the stakes clear. “Someone would ask him a question, and he’s giving the details of what would be in a dissertation without sounding like you are listening to a dissertation,” she said.', 'In October, the group formally endorsed fully funding the $52 billion package. Ms. Stevens called Mr. Gelsinger’s presentation “a complete instigator” for the decision.', 'transcript', 'This historic investment for Ohio, one of the largest investments in semiconductor manufacturing in American history: a brand new $20 billion campus outside of Columbus, Ohio. Semiconductors are small computer chips that power virtually everything in our lives — your phone, your car, your refrigerator, your washing machine. America invented these chips. Today, we barely produce 10 percent of the computer chips despite being the leader in chip design and research. We don’t have the ability to make the most advanced chips now — right now. But today, 75 percent of the production takes place in East Asia, 90 percent of the most advanced chips are made in Taiwan. China is doing everything it can to take over the global market. I want other cities and states to be able to make an announcement like the one being made here today, and that’s why I want to see Congress pass this bill right away and get it to my desk. Let’s get another historic piece of bipartisan legislation done. Let’s do it for the sake of our economic competitiveness and our national security.', 'On Jan. 21, Mr. Gelsinger arrived at the White House for a late morning briefing to announce that Intel planned to invest at least $20 billion in a new site in Ohio. It would be the company’s first new U.S. manufacturing campus in 40 years. President Biden patted Mr. Gelsinger on the shoulder as the Intel chief strode to the podium and later jokingly referred to him as “the boss.”', 'Later that day, Mr. Gelsinger flew to Columbus for a gathering with state and local officials. Marveling at his event with the president, he also described how Intel hoped to invest as much as $100 billion to build eight factories on the 1,000-acre site over a decade. That would make Ohio one of the world’s biggest chip production sites.', '“We are the company that helped to put silicon into Silicon Valley,” he said. “Today the silicon heartland begins.”']","['Gelsinger', 'Intel', 'chip', 'company', 'production', 'computer', 'manufacturing', 'percent', 'executive', 'year', 'today', 'factory', 'semiconductor', 'technology', 'time', 'Otellini', 'Grove', 'job', 'microprocessor', 'foundry']",images/158.png

But “it’s OK,” he added, because he believes he has help. “God, I need you showing up with me today because this job is way more than I could possibly do myself.”', 'If his father had managed to buy a farm, Mr. Gelsinger would almost certainly have inherited it and become a farmer. That was expected in Robesonia, a borough in Pennsylvania Dutch country where he was raised and worked on his uncles’ farms.', 'But there was no farm to inherit. So at age 16, Mr. Gelsinger passed a scholarship exam that took him to the Lincoln Technical Institute, a for-profit vocational school, where he earned an associate degree.', 'Mr. Gelsinger tells this and other stories self-deprecatingly in a 2003 book of advice that he wrote for Christians titled “Balancing Your Family, Faith & Work,” which was expanded in 2008 and titled, “The Juggling Act: Bringing Balance to Your Faith, Family, and Work.”', 'In 1979, he was interviewed at the technical institute by a manager from Intel. Unlike most of the other students there, Mr. Gelsinger had heard of the company. He breezed through questions related to his studies and predicted he could earn bachelor’s, master’s and Ph.D. degrees while holding down a full-time job, said Ronald Smith, the former Intel executive who conducted the interview.', '“He is very smart, very ambitious and arrogant,” Mr. Smith said he wrote in a summary of the conversation. “He’ll fit right in.”', 'Mr. Gelsinger took his first plane ride to interview at Intel in California, where he started in October 1979 as a technician. He worked on improving the reliability of microprocessors while studying for a bachelor’s degree at Santa Clara University.', 'He soon started hanging out with the engineers who designed the chips, coming up with ideas to test the chips more efficiently. In 1982, he became the fourth engineer on the team that introduced the groundbreaking 80386 microprocessor.', 'During a 1985 presentation near the completion of the chip, Mr. Gelsinger chided Intel’s leaders Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore and Andy Grove about balky company computers that were slowing the process.', 'A few days later, he got a surprise call from Mr. Grove. The Hungarian-born executive, then Intel’s president who later wrote the management book “Only the Paranoid Survive,” had built a culture where lower-level employees were encouraged to challenge superiors if they could back up their positions. Mr. Grove began mentoring Mr. Gelsinger, a relationship that lasted three decades.', 'By 1986, Mr. Grove had convinced Mr. Gelsinger not to pursue a doctorate at Stanford University and instead made him, at age 24, the leader of a 100-person team designing Intel’s 80486 microprocessor. Mr. Gelsinger eventually earned eight patents, became Intel’s youngest vice president in 1992 and the first person with the title of chief technology officer in 2001.', 'His climb up Intel’s ladder was shaped by another priority: his faith.', 'Though raised in the mainstream United Church of Christ, Mr. Gelsinger said he didn’t really become a Christian until he attended the nondenominational church in Silicon Valley where he met Linda Fortune, who later became his wife. It was at that church in 1980 that he heard the minister quote Revelations.', 'After Mr. Gelsinger became a born-again Christian, he wrestled privately with whether to join the clergy. In a 2019 oral history conducted by the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., he said he eventually decided to become a “workplace minister,” where “you really view yourself as working for God as your C.E.O., even though you’re working for Intel.”', 'In the mid-2000s, Mr. Gelsinger’s footing within Intel shifted. Mr. Grove retired as board chairman in 2004. Another executive, Paul Otellini, was appointed chief executive in 2005. Mr. Gelsinger said he was a “dissonant voice” on Intel’s senior executive team.', 'Mr. Otellini pushed him to leave, Mr. Gelsinger said. (Mr. Otellini died in 2017.) In 2009, Mr. Gelsinger accepted an offer to become president and chief operating officer of EMC, a maker of data storage gear.', 'Departing Intel after 30 years as a company man hurt badly. “I was just so angry and emotional about the departure,” Mr. Gelsinger said.', 'In 2012, he became chief executive of VMware, a software company that EMC controlled. He weathered challenges there, including an aborted effort to compete in cloud computing services with Amazon, but broadened the company’s business and nearly tripled revenues.', 'During those years, Intel slipped. For decades, the company had led the industry in delivering regular factory advances that pack more processing power into chips. But delays in perfecting new production processes allowed rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung Electronics to grab the lead in manufacturing technology between 2015 and 2019.', 'Today, T.S.M.C. makes chips designed by hundreds of other companies. It supplies the world with more than 90 percent of the chips made with the most advanced production technology. Because it is headquartered in Taiwan, which China has laid territorial claim to, its location has made it a political and supply chain chokepoint should conflict erupt over the island nation.', 'Intel was also suffering from its missteps in the mobile market, which consumes billions of processors compared with the hundreds of millions sold for computers.', 'After convincing Apple to use its chips in Macintosh computers in 2005, Intel had a chance to win a place in the iPhone, which debuted in 2007. But Mr. Otellini said in a 2013 interview in The Atlantic that he turned down the opportunity because the price that Apple was willing to pay for chips was too low to make a profit.', 'The decision, which Mr. Otellini said he regretted, led Apple to use rival Arm technology for smartphones and, later, tablets. So did Samsung and other companies that make devices using Google’s Android software. More recently, Apple started using Arm chips in many new Macs.', 'Mr. Otellini and his successors prioritized Intel’s profit margins while failing to take risks to move into new markets and outflank rivals, former company insiders now acknowledge. If boiled down to a book, “it could be called ‘the insufficiently paranoid don’t survive,’” said Reed Hundt, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman who served on Intel’s board from 2001 to 2020, in a nod to Mr. Grove’s “Only the Paranoid Survive.”', 'As questions swirled about Intel’s future, Mr. Gelsinger was viewed as a possible savior.

Today, we barely produce 10 percent of the computer chips despite being the leader in chip design and research. We don’t have the ability to make the most advanced chips now — right now.

Can It Make a Comeback?,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/technology/intel-ceo-patrick-gelsinger.html,"['Patrick Gelsinger was 18 years old and four months into an entry-level job at Intel when he heard a pivotal sermon at a Silicon Valley church in February 1980. There, a minister quoted Jesus from the Book of Revelation.', '“I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!” the minister said. “So, because you are lukewarm — neither hot nor cold — I am about to spit you out of my mouth.”', 'The words jolted Mr. Gelsinger, reshaping his philosophy. He realized he had been a lukewarm believer, one who practiced his faith just once a week. He vowed never to be neither hot nor cold again.', 'Now, at age 60, Mr. Gelsinger is hot about one thing in particular: Revitalizing Intel, a Silicon Valley icon that lost its leading position in chip manufacturing.', 'The 120,000-person company was a household name in the 1990s, celebrated as a fount of innovation as its microprocessors became the electronic brains in the vast majority of computers. But Intel failed to place its chips into smartphones, which became the device of choice for most people. Apple and Google instead grew into the trillion-dollar emblems of Silicon Valley.', 'Rejuvenating Intel is partly about Mr. Gelsinger’s own ambitions. As a young engineer, he once wrote down a goal of leading Intel one day. But in 2009, after spending his entire career at the company, he was forced out. A year ago, he was wooed back for a surprise second chance.', 'His mission is also about America’s place in the world. Mr. Gelsinger wants to return the United States to a leading role in semiconductor production, reducing the country’s dependence on manufacturers in Asia and easing a global chip shortage. Intel, he believes, can spearhead the charge. If he succeeds, the impact could extend far beyond computers to just about every device with an on-off switch.', 'The quest faces many obstacles. Steering a $200 billion company while chasing a goal of raising U.S. chip production to 30 percent globally from about 12 percent today requires tens of billions of dollars, political maneuvering with governments and years of patience.', '“You’re going to have to spend a lot of money and you’re going to have to spend it for a long period of time,” said Simon Segars, who recently stepped down as chief executive of Arm, a British company whose chip designs power most smartphones. “Whether governments have the stomach for that over the long term remains to be seen.”', 'In four interviews, Mr. Gelsinger acknowledged the difficulties. But the father of four and grandfather of eight has pursued the goals with intensity.', 'In March, he unveiled a $20 billion project to add two chip factories to Intel’s complex near Phoenix. Last month, he joined President Biden to showcase a $20 billion investment in a new chip manufacturing site near Columbus, Ohio. On Tuesday, he announced a $5.4 billion deal to buy Tower Semiconductor, which operates chip production services from factories in four countries.', 'To drum up government support for his investments, Mr. Gelsinger has attended three virtual White House gatherings, spoken with two dozen members of Congress and four governors. He became a key ally to President Biden over a $52 billion package that would provide grants to companies willing to set up new U.S. chip factories.

But the company promised those changes would not be as disruptive as a similar move by Apple last year.', 'Apple’s changes to its iOS software on iPhones asked users for permission before allowing advertisers to track them. Apple’s permission controls — and, ultimately, the decision by users to block tracking — have had a profound impact on internet companies that built businesses on so-called targeted advertising.', 'Google did not provide an exact timeline for its changes, but said it would support existing technologies for at least two more years.', 'This month, Meta, the company founded as Facebook, said Apple’s privacy changes would cost it $10 billion this year in lost advertising revenue. The revelation weighed on Meta’s stock price and led to concerns about other companies reliant on digital advertising.', 'Anthony Chavez, a vice president at Google’s Android division, said in an interview before the announcement that it was too early to gauge the potential impact from Google’s changes, which are meant to limit the sharing of data across apps and with third parties. But he emphasized that the company’s goal was to find a more private option for users while also allowing developers to continue to make advertising revenue.', 'As the world’s two biggest smartphone software providers, Google and Apple hold significant sway over what mobile apps can do on billions of devices. Changes to increase privacy or provide users with greater control over their data — a growing demand from customers, regulators and politicians — come at a cost for companies collecting data to sell ads personalized to a user’s interests and demographics.', 'Mr. Chavez said that if Google and Apple did not offer a privacy-minded alternative, advertisers might turn to more surreptitious options that could lead to fewer protections for users. He also argued that Apple’s “blunt approach” was proving “ineffective,” citing a study that said the changes in iOS had not had a meaningful impact in stopping third-party tracking.', 'An Apple spokesman declined to comment.', 'The changes from Google and Apple are significant because digital advertising based on the accumulation of data about users has underpinned the internet for the last 20 years. But that business model is facing more challenges as users have grown more suspicious about far-reaching data collection amid a general distrust of technology giants.', 'The difference in approaches between Apple and Google also speaks to how each company makes the bulk of its money. Apple generates most of its revenue from selling devices, while Google makes its money largely from selling digital advertising and may be more open to considering the needs of advertisers.', 'Wayne Coburn, a product director at Iterable, a marketing software company, said it was not surprising that Google was taking these steps when Apple was aggressively pitching privacy as a selling point over products running Android. Still, he said Google’s approach felt like a “weak gesture” by providing a two-year timeline. He expects the company will be pressured to “do more, faster.”', '“This is a reaction to what Apple has done,” Mr. Coburn said. “Google wouldn’t be doing this on their own.”', 'Google said it planned to bring its privacy initiative, Privacy Sandbox, which had been limited mainly to reducing tracking on the company’s Chrome browser, to Android — the world’s most widely used software for mobile devices. Google has been forced to revamp its approach to eliminating so-called cookies, a tracking tool, on Chrome while facing resistance from privacy groups and advertisers.', 'Google said it was proposing some new privacy-minded approaches in Android to allow advertisers to gauge the performance of ad campaigns and show personalized ads based on past behavior or recent interests — as well as new tools to limit covert tracking through apps. Google did not offer much in terms of detail about how these new alternatives would work.', 'As part of the changes, Google said, it plans to phase out Advertising ID, a tracking feature within Android that helps advertisers know whether users clicked on an ad or bought a product as well as keep tabs on their interests and activities. Google said it already allowed users to opt out of personalized ads by removing the tracking identifier.', 'The company said it planned to eliminate identifiers used in advertising on Android for everyone — including Google. Mr. Chavez said Google’s own apps would not have special or privileged access to Android data or features without specifying how that would work. This echoes a pledge Google made to regulators in Britain that it would not give preferential treatment to its own products.', 'The company did not offer a definitive timeline for eliminating Advertising ID, but it committed to keeping the existing system in place for two years. Google said it would offer preview versions of its new proposals to advertisers, before releasing a more complete test version this year.', 'Mr. Chavez said Google’s move had not been prompted by Apple’s actions, adding that the company is always looking to “raise the bar” on privacy.']","['Google', 'company', 'Apple', 'user', 'privacy', 'change', 'Android', 'advertising', 'datum', 'year', 'advertiser', 'tracking', 'software', 'ad', 'approach', 'product', 'Chavez', 'app', 'impact', 'timeline']",images/163.png

A virus flourished, and office buildings emptied, with their tenants uploading their systems to the ether; the cloud filled and then it filled some more, and with that massive digital shift, Dyba found herself, a person who majored in psychology, who could be intimidated briefly by the “merge calls” function on her iPhone, working in a field so hot that it is sucking more and more people like her into its ever-expanding vortex: technology recruiting.', 'Recruiters working in technology these days do not receive candy, flowers or thank-yous.

Estimates of the unemployment rates for tech workers are about 1.7 percent, compared with roughly 4 percent in the general economy; for those with expertise in cybersecurity, it’s more like 0.2 percent. Tech employees today tire of the attention from recruiters, the friendly hellos on LinkedIn, the cold calls (which Dyba does not make). “They think we’re like used-car salesmen,” Dyba said of her quarry. To be a recruiter in tech is to be an in-demand commodity for those companies doing the hiring but to feel like something of a nuisance — like an essential gear that emits a loud, irritating noise.', 'In late January, Dyba, working on contract with a tech company on the West Coast, sent out a mass blast on LinkedIn, tailored to reach data analysts, which is to say free of the kind of friendly, conversational fillips she might otherwise include (“Your LinkedIn profile looks amazing” and “I hope this finds you well!”). Data analysts — really, they just want the data. “Hi [name],” Dyba wrote in the message. “We’re looking for a talented Data Analyst to analyze huge data sets, build predictive models, and help us drive growth. I thought you could be a great fit.” The job she posted listed its selling points — the business had 400 percent growth a year, the backing of a legendary venture capitalist, no limit to personal vacation days, full coverage of employee health-care premiums and the option to work remote or locally.', 'Dyba estimates that she sent the listing to about 75 prospective hires and received back maybe five responses, three of which were either a brief “no thanks” or the simple declination of her InMail message. A declination — that’s LinkedIn language for “Please, stop throwing all these jobs at me with employer-paid health-insurance premiums and unlimited vacation time.”', 'Recruiters are in such demand that they, too, are scarce, which means their fees have never been higher. In-house tech-recruiter salaries are up about 30 percent, estimates Daniel Wert, who works at a boutique executive-search firm in the design community. Organizations looking for help in cloud and cybersecurity positions have increased fees they are offering to recruiting services to as high as 45 percent of the first year’s salary, says Ryan Sutton, a district president in charge of technology recruiting for the staffing firm Robert Half. Dyba says she has more work than she has had since she started freelance-recruiting in 2018.', 'Dyba’s challenges — most tech recruiters’ challenges — go beyond simply finding humans. As the people talking to potential hires, recruiters have a big-picture view of just how quickly the market is currently moving, something they need to translate to hiring managers without giving the impression they’re doing a hard sell. Dyba recently wrote to an executive who was hesitating to make an offer on a hire who was slipping away, texting a kind of recruiter haiku:', 'we need to moveif we are gonna movejust thought I would tell you', 'Recruiters are often in the position of breaking the bad news that a desired candidate has flat-out rejected an offer, often to executives used to having the upper hand in the market or to founders convinced their business is more innovative than Apple and with better snacks than Facebook.', 'Jana Rich, founder and chief executive of Rich Talent Group, a firm that primarily recruits executives to companies in the tech and consumer industries, says that even at the highest levels of hiring, she has never seen a market like this in 30 years. It falls on her, sometimes, to have what she calls “the truth talk” with a chief executive or board member: to break the news that qualified candidates have multiple — or sometimes preferable — opportunities. Now, she gently explains, an employer might have to think about taking a leap of faith on someone very talented but slightly less experienced. It doesn’t always go well. Following a recent truth talk, she said, the company put the search on pause, making it clear that “basically, ‘We, the company, don’t necessarily believe you,’” she said. “Like, ‘We think we can do better.’”', 'Pent-up demand after those early pandemic months when no one was hiring is part of the problem, Rich says. And a general feeling of pandemic malaise can help explain the shortage of potential hires — every so often, she reaches out to someone with a top-level job, only to hear, as she put it, “I don’t know if I have the energy in the tank.”', 'Highly skilled tech workers, for the most part, are not leaving the workplace — the money right now is simply too good (salaries have risen in some cities by as much as 10 percent). They are, however, leaving the workspace, in droves, to work remotely, which is another aspect of the new world of work that recruiters need to communicate to founders and chief executives, some of whom are intent on getting the office back to what it once was.', '“If you are not going to offer remote work, if you’re not going to offer at least hybrid, we can’t help you,” Sutton says he tells clients trying to hire software designers. Tatiana Becker, the founder of NIAH Recruiting, was called in to help another recruiter from a different firm, who had already contacted every local potential candidate to fill a chief-of-staff position at an online retailer that hoped to have its employees in the office full time. After Becker told her colleague that the employer was going to have to drop one of the three requirements to fill the position — ideally, the one that called for regular on-site work in New York — the client wrote her a snippy email making it clear that Becker’s help was no longer wanted: “Unfortunately the recommendation you made to drop one or two of our requirements,” the client wrote, “was frankly completely inappropriate.”', 'When working with one employer in a city that is not known as a tech hub, Dyba felt that she had to chip away, carefully, at the company’s insistence for on-site workers; one position had been open for six months. Dyba started showing the hiring manager the credentials for someone she’d found, but omitted a crucial detail. If the employer was interested, then and only then did she reveal that the talent was based in Florida or Boston. “I had to kind of say, ‘Listen, it’s costing more money right now for us to keep this job open than it would be for you to send someone a laptop and coach your leadership team differently about how to manage remotely,’” she said. She believes the hiring manager raised the issue with the chief executive; slowly, someone with decision-making power came around, and Dyba was able to start filling positions. When the pandemic ebbs and local workers are back in that office, 15 to 20 percent of its work force will be remote. The market rather than Dyba changed the company’s workplace culture — a market of empowered technology workers who could pick and choose their employers, who could take or leave any job they wanted and were forcing a shift.', 'Dyba hit a low back in October, when after working for months to land a signed offer for a qualified candidate for one company, she then lost that hire when the candidate’s current employer swooped in with a generous, last-minute retention bonus. She had a signed offer! That had never happened to her before. Now she counts on nothing: “I don’t stop interviewing until I have a butt in the seat — like I am aggressively still looking for candidates even after we have a signed offer.”', 'Workplaces also keep shifting unpredictably in ways that wreak havoc on the hiring process. A business doesn’t have a vaccine requirement, then it does. Employees are told they can work remotely and then the employer starts floating the idea that everyone will need to come back. Between constantly changing conditions and the number of counteroffers that job candidates receive, Sutton says, around four in five of the deals his recruiters try to seal end up requiring last-minute finessing on some major point; that happened only about 30 percent of the time before the pandemic, he estimates.', 'By late January, Dyba had been trying for several months, with mounting frustration, to find someone for a senior position for a high-growth start-up whose executive team insisted that the position be filled by someone willing to work at least part time on-site in New York. The calculation, when chief executives still make it, has become an interesting leap of faith. It reflects a belief that having a team on the ground, regularly working together, sharing the air and locking eyes across a conference table, will yield greater success than handpicking the most talented, experienced team a recruiter could possibly source from all 50 states and having them forge some new kind of work environment from their respective remote locales.', 'All day long, Dyba sent out feelers, and all day she got back messages on LinkedIn, variations on the same thing: “Is there any chance that this position could be 100 percent remote?” one woman asked. “If not, I would not be interested in hearing more about the role.” Dyba visited the start-up’s New York office, which was, predictably, filled with great light and had Kombucha on tap. It was vast, the lease signed during the pandemic. It was also basically empty. Dyba had to wonder in what numbers even current employees would eventually return to on-site work.', 'At least that other client, the tech employer on the West Coast seeking a data analyst, was willing to let whoever filled that position work entirely remotely. In late January, around 5:30 p.m., Dyba got on a screening call with a potential candidate. By then, she had reached the stage of day when her hair was up in a messy bun held with a pen. She was working in her bedroom, in green thermal pants and a Henley — it was not a big Zoom day — and her ancient Corgi was snoozing by her side. The day had been nonstop, and she hadn’t paused to drink any water, which she was now compensating for by chugging from a bottle while the candidate spoke.', '“If you wouldn’t mind kind of talking me through your background, I would love to hear a little bit more about you and what you’ve been doing,” she said. The young man on the other end of the phone was lovely and polite, with a Master of Science degree in business analytics. Dyba was immediately charmed, if only because — unlike so many tech recruits — he didn’t start the conversation by asking, within the first six minutes, what the compensation was. He spoke about his background but also seemed to have researched the business itself. The nature of work has changed so much that sometimes, she knows, the recruits don’t care: Their top priority is remote work; and if they are going to be doing data analytics at home, a basic disconnect from the larger business can easily set in. (Another recruiter said that when she sends out mass blasts, she often gets back emails that say only three words: “Rate? Remote? Client?”)', 'Dyba recognized that there were details on the young man’s résumé that the employer might consider less than reassuring — like the fact that his last job had the word “intern” in it. “My fear is that they’ll say he doesn’t have the experience,” she said of the tech firm. But still, he impressed her with his obvious intelligence, his sophisticated response to a question about machine learning. She would fight for him and suggest, “If you’re willing to take a chance and help someone start his career, I think it would be a great move.” Maybe they would listen, she thought. Maybe.']","['Dyba', 'recruiter', 'tech', 'work', 'percent', 'employer', 'position', 'candidate', 'day', 'executive', 'job', 'company', 'office', 'worker', 'business', 'LinkedIn', 'hire', 'technology', 'employee', 'firm']",images/164.png

They are, however, leaving the workspace, in droves, to work remotely, which is another aspect of the new world of work that recruiters need to communicate to founders and chief executives, some of whom are intent on getting the office back to what it once was.', '“If you are not going to offer remote work, if you’re not going to offer at least hybrid, we can’t help you,” Sutton says he tells clients trying to hire software designers. Tatiana Becker, the founder of NIAH Recruiting, was called in to help another recruiter from a different firm, who had already contacted every local potential candidate to fill a chief-of-staff position at an online retailer that hoped to have its employees in the office full time. After Becker told her colleague that the employer was going to have to drop one of the three requirements to fill the position — ideally, the one that called for regular on-site work in New York — the client wrote her a snippy email making it clear that Becker’s help was no longer wanted: “Unfortunately the recommendation you made to drop one or two of our requirements,” the client wrote, “was frankly completely inappropriate.”', 'When working with one employer in a city that is not known as a tech hub, Dyba felt that she had to chip away, carefully, at the company’s insistence for on-site workers; one position had been open for six months. Dyba started showing the hiring manager the credentials for someone she’d found, but omitted a crucial detail. If the employer was interested, then and only then did she reveal that the talent was based in Florida or Boston. “I had to kind of say, ‘Listen, it’s costing more money right now for us to keep this job open than it would be for you to send someone a laptop and coach your leadership team differently about how to manage remotely,’” she said. She believes the hiring manager raised the issue with the chief executive; slowly, someone with decision-making power came around, and Dyba was able to start filling positions. When the pandemic ebbs and local workers are back in that office, 15 to 20 percent of its work force will be remote. The market rather than Dyba changed the company’s workplace culture — a market of empowered technology workers who could pick and choose their employers, who could take or leave any job they wanted and were forcing a shift.', 'Dyba hit a low back in October, when after working for months to land a signed offer for a qualified candidate for one company, she then lost that hire when the candidate’s current employer swooped in with a generous, last-minute retention bonus. She had a signed offer! That had never happened to her before. Now she counts on nothing: “I don’t stop interviewing until I have a butt in the seat — like I am aggressively still looking for candidates even after we have a signed offer.”', 'Workplaces also keep shifting unpredictably in ways that wreak havoc on the hiring process. A business doesn’t have a vaccine requirement, then it does. Employees are told they can work remotely and then the employer starts floating the idea that everyone will need to come back. Between constantly changing conditions and the number of counteroffers that job candidates receive, Sutton says, around four in five of the deals his recruiters try to seal end up requiring last-minute finessing on some major point; that happened only about 30 percent of the time before the pandemic, he estimates.', 'By late January, Dyba had been trying for several months, with mounting frustration, to find someone for a senior position for a high-growth start-up whose executive team insisted that the position be filled by someone willing to work at least part time on-site in New York. The calculation, when chief executives still make it, has become an interesting leap of faith. It reflects a belief that having a team on the ground, regularly working together, sharing the air and locking eyes across a conference table, will yield greater success than handpicking the most talented, experienced team a recruiter could possibly source from all 50 states and having them forge some new kind of work environment from their respective remote locales.', 'All day long, Dyba sent out feelers, and all day she got back messages on LinkedIn, variations on the same thing: “Is there any chance that this position could be 100 percent remote?” one woman asked. “If not, I would not be interested in hearing more about the role.” Dyba visited the start-up’s New York office, which was, predictably, filled with great light and had Kombucha on tap. It was vast, the lease signed during the pandemic. It was also basically empty. Dyba had to wonder in what numbers even current employees would eventually return to on-site work.', 'At least that other client, the tech employer on the West Coast seeking a data analyst, was willing to let whoever filled that position work entirely remotely. In late January, around 5:30 p.m., Dyba got on a screening call with a potential candidate. By then, she had reached the stage of day when her hair was up in a messy bun held with a pen. She was working in her bedroom, in green thermal pants and a Henley — it was not a big Zoom day — and her ancient Corgi was snoozing by her side. The day had been nonstop, and she hadn’t paused to drink any water, which she was now compensating for by chugging from a bottle while the candidate spoke.', '“If you wouldn’t mind kind of talking me through your background, I would love to hear a little bit more about you and what you’ve been doing,” she said. The young man on the other end of the phone was lovely and polite, with a Master of Science degree in business analytics. Dyba was immediately charmed, if only because — unlike so many tech recruits — he didn’t start the conversation by asking, within the first six minutes, what the compensation was. He spoke about his background but also seemed to have researched the business itself. The nature of work has changed so much that sometimes, she knows, the recruits don’t care: Their top priority is remote work; and if they are going to be doing data analytics at home, a basic disconnect from the larger business can easily set in. (Another recruiter said that when she sends out mass blasts, she often gets back emails that say only three words: “Rate? Remote? Client?”)', 'Dyba recognized that there were details on the young man’s résumé that the employer might consider less than reassuring — like the fact that his last job had the word “intern” in it. “My fear is that they’ll say he doesn’t have the experience,” she said of the tech firm. But still, he impressed her with his obvious intelligence, his sophisticated response to a question about machine learning. She would fight for him and suggest, “If you’re willing to take a chance and help someone start his career, I think it would be a great move.” Maybe they would listen, she thought. Maybe.']","['Dyba', 'recruiter', 'tech', 'work', 'percent', 'employer', 'position', 'candidate', 'day', 'executive', 'job', 'company', 'office', 'worker', 'business', 'LinkedIn', 'hire', 'technology', 'employee', 'firm']",images/165.png

At a meeting on Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and Meta’s chief executive, announced a new name for his company’s employees: Metamates.', 'Mr. Zuckerberg introduced the term as part of an overhaul of Meta’s corporate values, which he said needed updating because of the company’s new direction. In October, he took many by surprise by shifting Facebook toward the so-called metaverse, in which different computing platforms are connected to one another across the internet. The move de-emphasized the company’s social networking apps, like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, which have been under scrutiny for privacy and data challenges, hateful content and misinformation.', 'So past Facebook values like “Be bold” and “Focus on impact”? They are gone. In their place are “Live in the future,” “Build awesome things,” “Focus on long-term impact” and “Meta, Metamates, me,” Mr. Zuckerberg said on Tuesday.

Palantir, a big data software company, even emblazoned the slogan “Save the Shire,” a “Lord of the Rings” reference, on employee T-shirts. All of that gave rise to sendups of the tech world like HBO’s “Silicon Valley.”', 'For Mr. Zuckerberg, the latest values represent a kind of fresh start for his company, even though the metaverse is far from formed. But Meta’s employees greeted the reset on Tuesday with mixed reactions.', 'On some internal forums, hundreds of employees welcomed the changes with heart emojis. Yet in private chat messages, away from the eyes of managers, some workers expressed more skepticism.', '“How is this going to change the company? I don’t understand the messaging,” one engineer wrote in a private chat viewed by The New York Times. “We keep changing the name of everything, and it is confusing.”', 'Another employee said being a Metamate reminded him of sailing. “Does this mean we are on a sinking ship?” the worker wrote.', 'Others said the new slogans had a “military inspiration” or gave a sense of being “a cog in a machine,” according to employee posts reviewed by The Times. And on Twitter, one Meta employee made fun of the new values, replacing them with “conform” and “obey.” He quickly deleted the message.', 'Meta declined to comment on the employee posts.', 'The Metamates moniker was coined by Douglas Hofstadter, a professor of cognitive science at Indiana University and author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid.” In a tweet, Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, said an employee had emailed Mr. Hofstadter for ideas for a rebrand.', 'In an email, Mr. Hofstadter said he had originally suggested “teammate” to describe Meta’s employees, since each half of the word is an anagram of Meta. In a postscript, he recommended Metamate as an alternative. He added that he was unaware the company had adopted the name.', 'The origins. The word “metaverse” describes a fully realized digital world\xa0that exists beyond the one in which we live. It was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel “Snow Crash,” and\xa0the concept was further explored by\xa0Ernest Cline\xa0in his\xa0novel “Ready Player One.”', 'An expanding universe.

His company also resembles a scaled-down version of the Gap, employing a fashion designer, logistics experts, graphic designers and “fit technicians” to sell merchandise to fans.', 'Sebastian is among the online personalities who have figured out that putting their names or faces on products is increasingly a ticket to cashing in on fame.', 'Sales of themed merchandise like hoodies and plush toy video game controllers generated about 32 percent of the revenue for Sebastian’s Linus Media Group in 2021, up from 3 percent five years earlier, he told me. Sebastian said that “clothing is where really successful people like the Kardashians of the world” earn a living. (This isn’t totally true, but you get the idea.)', 'Advertising, the conventional way for people to earn money from online attention, is a bit more than half of the revenue for Linus Media Group. Most of the company’s videos about computers, video games and other tech gear have plugs for sponsors, and Sebastian’s company collects a share of revenue from ads and subscriptions that YouTube sells.', 'But it’s the merchandise that is both growing faster than other income streams, and requires different expertise than anything Sebastian has done before. “You can’t just slap your label on a T-shirt and hope that people will buy it,” he said.', 'On Tech has been writing a series of newsletters on the economics of internet creators, or people like Sebastian who are so good at making online videos and other material that they turn it into a living.', 'Sebastian offers a glimpse at the skills it takes to build a 21st-century media company. He is the chief executive who is equally comfortable sawing open old cable TV boxes for 14 million video subscribers and talking with me about wonky financial metrics.', 'Sebastian’s decade-long path to becoming a YouTube star essentially started with a dare from his former boss. Sebastian was working for a computer retail store, and it asked him to make videos to drum up sales. It’s easy to see why they caught on. Sebastian radiates fun in his videos even if, like me, you would never build a solid gold video game controller.', 'Then he had a disagreement over strategy with a higher-up, who told Sebastian that he could either fall in line or find another place to make videos, Sebastian said. He picked the second option. Sebastian started his own YouTube channel in 2013 and formed a business with his wife just months after they had their first child.', 'Today, Linus Media Group has about 65 employees, and a half-dozen YouTube channels that have a combined monthly viewership that could compete with the Super Bowl’s. Staff members write scripts, produce the videos and cut deals with sponsors. They also built a streaming video site to make money away from YouTube.', 'About 11 people work just on merchandise. Employees order blank water bottles and underwear from factories and contract with a local printing company in the Vancouver area to customize them. Others specialize in clothing design, customer service or moving products around the world.

All who entered were required to have identification, and guards recorded who came and went.', 'Now, as pandemic restrictions ease and workers begin to trickle back into the office, the lobby is changing again, this time with an emphasis on health and safety. But the changes are subtle, and they are primarily meant to ease the flow at the turnstile.', 'Most notably, mobile applications tied to building security or operating systems are replacing plastic ID badges for workers and the check-in process for visitors. The goal is to digitally connect anyone entering the building while minimizing direct contact. Body scanners and air sensors are expected to become more prominent in the future.', 'Unlike the extra security measures of the post-9/11 world, which were plain to see, the latest changes will go largely unnoticed, said Jurgen Timperman, president of fire and security at Carrier Global, a provider of building operating systems based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.', '“With these applications, we have all the information we need about someone before they get to the building,” he said. “So the days where somebody sits behind a desk with a big book and pen are all but over.”', 'Building apps allow users to upload identification and other credentials, like their vaccine status, and offer the flexibility to add functions like health questionnaires that prescreen employees or visitors before their arrival. The apps can also track users throughout a building, which can help companies use space more efficiently or close areas to reduce occupancy.', 'Vendors are tight-lipped when it comes to how much building systems cost, as are the landlords who have installed them. One problem, they say, is that price varies with a building’s size and layout and the number of people, sensors and functions on the system.', 'The behind-the-scenes overhaul of security systems is catching on in office buildings and even at universities. Students and faculty at the Rochester Institute of Technology in upstate New York, for example, use a system from Carrier for mobile entry to buildings on campus.', 'The New York developer Silverstein Properties has introduced a contactless entry system for tenants at 7 World Trade Center in Manhattan that allows employees to use badges stored in Apple Wallet to gain access to office and amenity spaces. And at Deutsche Bank’s new offices in the former Time Warner Center, vaccination status is loaded onto employee badges for entry through its turnstiles, a spokesman said.', 'In August, Rubenstein Partners rolled out a platform and app from HqO, a provider of building operating systems, at a 500,000-square-foot office building known as 25 Kent in Brooklyn, about 16 months after it opened. Rubenstein had decided before the pandemic to use the technology in the new development, but the desire to create a contactless entry hastened the timing.', '“In the past, when someone visited an office, you’d hand your ID to a security person. But with Covid, distance became a concern,” said Salvatore Dragone, director of property management for Rubenstein, which is based in Philadelphia. “Now you can preregister, and your phone opens a turnstile or elevator door. It gives us a lot more control as to who comes into the building.”', 'In addition to the apps, permanent but discreet temperature and body scanners and air sensors in lobbies and elsewhere could become more commonplace, especially if other airborne viruses or more coronavirus variants emerge.', 'As property managers continue to reimagine the office lobby, tenants and visitors can also expect a “concierge feel” in addition to basic security, Mr. Dragone said, as music, HVAC fragrance diffusers, art and other experiential elements become more commonplace.', 'And those plexiglass dividers? “I don’t think they’re there for good,” he added, “nor do we want them to stay longer than need be.”', 'The technology continues a movement to automate manual processes across industries. But in commercial real estate, it is also part of a trend to create a more hospitable and inviting atmosphere by borrowing ideas from hotel lobbies, like seating lounges and meeting areas, said Lenny Beaudoin, who oversees workplace, design and occupancy for CBRE, a commercial real estate brokerage firm. CBRE also created Host, an app for tenants and landlords, and other digital building operating solutions.', '“What owners are providing in lobbies is largely a response to what tenants want, and ultimately that’s a more connected experience,” said Sandeep Davé, the chief digital and technology officer at CBRE. “The focus now is on the convergence of functions on a smartphone that will provide a contactless experience and encourage people to return to work, and to return safely.”', 'The pandemic has accelerated interest in contactless solutions, said James Scott, the lead researcher at the Real Estate Innovation Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.', '“In light of Covid, the acceptance of new technology and its implementation became extremely important,” he said. “The adoption rate has accelerated by anywhere from three to five years.”', 'In a 2021 global survey, nearly two-thirds of 250 respondents said they had either adopted mobile credentialing to control building access or planned to over the next two years, according to IFSEC Global, an international security and fire safety news and conference organization in London.', 'Despite the urgency created by the pandemic, some landlords and property managers are still mulling how to best strengthen their lobby safety and security, and by how much.', 'Complicating matters is the lack of a unified system. The sector for building software solutions remains fragmented, with several property technology companies competing. And the abilities are still being explored. For instance, apps have been developed to automatically call an elevator when a person enters a building, but technology providers have yet to roll out the feature in a significant way, Mr. Scott said.', 'The same is true for the deployment of automated temperature scanners, he added. In many cases, temporary temperature-taking stations disappeared in 2021, before the Omicron variant of the coronavirus took hold.', '“Once a pandemic loses its steam, these types of temporary measures tend to gather dust in a storage room unless they have been integrated into the framework of the building management system,” Mr. Scott said.', 'Expense is also a consideration, particularly in older buildings that lack a robust technology foundation, said W.A. Watts IV, president of the Institute of Real Estate Management, an international organization for property and asset managers.', 'For example, a project to retrofit an 18-year-old, 25,000-square-foot building in Birmingham, Ala., costs around $5 a square foot just to install base infrastructure, said Mr. Watts, who goes by Chip.
