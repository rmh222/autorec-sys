       "   'The problem is that 5G millimeter wave technology travels short distances and has trouble penetrating walls and obstacles. As a result, it’s rare to even find a connection. People who buy an iPhone SE probably won’t even know that it is missing.',\n",

The iPhone SE camera also lacks the special night mode found on the fancier iPhones for taking photos in the dark. Using flash is always an option, though.',\n",
       "   'The most obvious difference was the screen. The iPhone SE’s 4.7-inch screen felt constrained and looked dimmer compared with pricier iPhones, which have displays of 5.4 to 6.7 inches. This was probably the most distinguishing factor — if your eyesight isn’t great or if you spend lots of time streaming videos, you will probably prefer a bigger screen.',\n",

       "   'It’s worth remembering that there are other strong phone contenders in the iPhone SE’s price range. Those include Google’s $400 Pixel 5A, which has different pros and cons. In my tests, the Google phone has a slightly larger screen and takes better photos in low light. But the Pixel phone wasn’t as fast as the iPhone SE, and it may not last as long because Google guarantees software updates for the device only until 2024.',\n",
       "   'In the end, though, both phones excelled at doing what we need them to do — connect with the internet, place phone calls and take pictures — at a fraction of the price of their higher-end counterparts.

       "   'Like fancier iPhones, the new iPhone SE includes connectivity to 5G, the latest cellular network.

That’s not mind-blowing, but it’s a nice feature to have as 5G networks become more widespread.',\n",

       "   'The problem is that 5G millimeter wave technology travels short distances and has trouble penetrating walls and obstacles. As a result, it’s rare to even find a connection. People who buy an iPhone SE probably won’t even know that it is missing.',\n",

Two men — Ludo and Daniel — stand by a portable sauna mounted on a trailer bed. “So, you were in here?” Daniel says, pointing forcefully. “And they just took it from you?” Ludo confirms. “Oh, my God,” Daniel says, turning to the camera in the manner of someone practiced at generating on-the-scene narration for viewers at home: “Crazy story. You go to the sauna. You’re relaxing inside. And the next thing you know, your bike, which is parked next to you, just gets stolen. Double-locked, they carried it away.” He’s visibly peeved: This can’t stand. “Nah. Let’s find this bike.”',\n",
       "   'Welcome to “Bike Hunters,” a YouTube series produced by VanMoof, a Dutch e-bike company. When you buy a VanMoof, starting at $2,298, you can also subscribe to a theft-protection package. If your bike is stolen, VanMoof will either recover it within two weeks — possibly by sending Daniel or another “hunter” — or replace it. Each VanMoof comes with an electronic tracking system designed to make it easier to find. I’ve watched VanMoof’s bike hunters, tracking devices in hand, traipsing through cities all over the world — Berlin, San Francisco, London, Tokyo — following signals to street corners, basements, scrap-metal sites and tent cities. (The series bumps up against urban poverty and homelessness, but tends to restrict itself to thinking about them in terms of bike security.) Often the hunters themselves cruise from clue to clue on VanMoofs, showing off the bikes’ sleek design and the benefits of giving your pedaling an electronic boost.',\n",
       "   'Sometimes the hunters find the bike chained up — or parked in a specialized structure that may, to American viewers, look like something from another world — and liberate it with a power cutter. Sometimes they confront the bike’s new “owner,” always possibly the thief himself, but perhaps just someone who got a deal they might have known was too good to be true. (“I bought it for 10 euros,” one man says, shrugging.) Whatever happens, the story is told in the grammar of reality TV. Quick-cut montages boil hours of searches and stakeouts down to mere minutes, backed by techno music that makes the hunts feel consistently adrenalized. The hunters speak in narrative beats: “Let’s find this bike. ... We were waiting for this bike to move, and it just moved. ... We have to go right now!”',\n",
       "   'In Stockholm, Daniel and Ludo follow the tracker signal to a group of apartment buildings. As they interview residents, Daniel picks up “super tense” energy from a man who runs off before they can approach him. Searching the area, they spot a telltale VanMoof handlebar sticking out from a balcony. Daniel uses a digital signal to verify it’s Ludo’s bike, then calls the police, who help recover it. Overjoyed, Ludo hops on and begins riding.',\n",
       "   '“Bike Hunters” takes a product category with massive potential to increase the public good, then talks about it in a surprisingly goofy way: via reality-TV-inflected short videos about young people executing what sometimes seem like awfully inefficient retrieval operations. (In two early episodes, several VanMoof employees flew from the Netherlands to Ukraine and Romania, spending days, and significant amounts of carbon, on the trails of bikes they never found.) The show can be a little silly. It’s for exactly this reason that it feels terribly important.',\n",
       "   'Consider cars, the core of the problem e-bikes promise to help solve. Much of cars’ dominance of United States transit culture stems from the accumulated power of a century of political decisions. But some credit must also be given to the car’s great success at infiltrating every crevice of our culture. Cars come to us in advertisements, in films, in song lyrics; they’re powerful, they’re sexy, they’re fun.',\n",
       "   'Bicycles, by contrast — the everyday, getting-from-A-to-B type — are offered as the vegetables to cars’ steak. Prudent and responsible, maybe. Powerful and sexy, definitely not. Ditto for the likes of public transit and walkable neighborhoods, options often presented in the sober register of a nonprofit report. There’s talk of safety, public health and the negatives we might avoid: death and injury counts, toxic emission figures, congestion statistics. We hear about fun and pleasure only in footnotes and asides, if at all. This dynamic applies far beyond transit. Eating less meat, buying less clothing, wearing masks indoors during a disease outbreak: Too often, demonstrably good interventions arrive via scolding exhortations to eat our vegetables, both real and metaphorical. Not because the vegetables are tasty, but because eating steak is bad for the planet and we should know better.',\n",
       "   'Psychologists distinguish between “avoidance motivation” (which steers us away from threats) and “approach motivation” (which guides us toward rewards), stressing the need for individuals to balance the two. People who drink too much, for example, might have a better chance of changing if they can, in addition to understanding alcohol’s negative toll on their life, envision how drinking less could add positives, like better relationships with loved ones. “If I can’t dance, I don’t want to be in your revolution,” the anarchist Emma Goldman is often quoted as saying. In fact, the phrase seems to have been coined by an activist printing T-shirts for a fund-raiser, but the point stands: Surely we need more to look forward to than the avoidance of worst-case scenarios.',\n",
       "   'In its own small way, “Bike Hunters” offers a hint of how to gaze forward. Importantly, it exists not to make you feel bad but to make you want a fancy bike — to see a bike as an aspirational good, more steak than vegetable, something you would be crushed to have stolen. The episodes are littered with scenes of bike-\\u200brelated happiness. A crowd gathered on an Amsterdam street cheers while hunters grind the lock off a stolen bike. A Moroccan medical student who learns he has bought a stolen bike invites the hunters in for tea, signs up to be a hunter himself and gets a free bike as a thank-you. We see how pleased VanMoof owners are to have their bikes recovered, as if getting pieces of their lives back. In my favorite episodes, the hunt showcases the everyday pleasures and conveniences of bikeable streets and bike-friendly spaces. We see bikes everywhere, woven into the fabric of neighborhood life. It always looks like something worth working toward. Yes, the way the show whistles past the radical inequalities of urban life can be annoying. (Though it’s nothing compared with, say, media coverage of carjacking.) But it would be a mistake to let this discredit its entire method. The lens is a powerful one; it just needs to be widened.',\n",
       "   'Since watching the Stockholm episode, hardly a week has gone by in which I haven’t imagined how wonderful it would be to feel safe biking to a sauna, emerging refreshed and biking off again into the rest of my day. After Ludo has his bike back, he and Daniel head to downtown Stockholm for karaoke. Daniel sings ABBA’s “Super Trouper”: “Smiling, having fun/Feeling like a number one.” Ludo opts for “Feeling Good,” a song used often in commercials for cars, including the 2022 Toyota Tundra pickup. “It’s a new dawn,” it says. “It’s a new day, it’s a new life.”',\n",

       "   'Here are the three main lessons I learned.',\n",
       "   'There is no one-size-fits-all advice for saving energy. I learned this in December 2020 when I first started using Google’s Nest thermostat, which can create a heating and cooling schedule based on your usage habits throughout the day.',\n",
       "   'The Department of Energy and utilities like PG&E and Consolidated Edison recommended setting the thermostat at 68 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter. So I programmed the Nest for 68 throughout the day.',\n",
       "   'When the $370 bill arrived a month later, I realized that the rule of thumb was terrible for my two-bedroom home, which was built in the 1960s with insulation treated as an afterthought. Once the house reached 68 degrees, it couldn’t retain that temperature for long, so the furnace powered back on about 20 minutes later.',\n",
       "   'This is all to say that saving energy with tech requires some independent thinking. While leaving the thermostat at 68 all day may make sense for small apartments in well-insulated buildings, this is generic advice that many homes probably wouldn’t benefit from, said Ben Brown, Google’s product manager for the Nest thermostat.',\n",
       "   'Instead, ask yourself some questions. What is the size of your home? What do you know about the insulation? How long does it take to heat up a few degrees? And most important, at what temperature would you and your family feel comfortable?',\n",
       "   'In November, I decided to try to make the Nest work better with my home this winter. After tinkering with the Nest’s settings and studying my energy costs every day for a month, I concluded that this was the best schedule for my house:',\n",
       "   '6:30 a.m.: Raise the temperature to 66, for when it’s time to get out of bed.',\n",
       "   '8 a.m.: Set the temperature to 60 so that the temperature steadily drops throughout the day. This made the house a bit chilly but tolerable wearing a sweater.',\n",
       "   '8 p.m.: Raise the temperature to 66, for when it gets cold at night (and after PG&E’s peak-pricing period).',\n",
       "   '11 p.m.: Set the temperature to 57, for bedtime.',\n",
       "   'During this experiment, the Nest thermostat also gave me a “heads-up” warning that my furnace was turning on and off every few minutes, which meant something was wrong. I hired an HVAC professional who diagnosed and fixed the problem: The gas pressure was too high, causing the furnace to overheat and shut down automatically.',\n",
       "   'This solution, combined with the programmed heating schedule, led to a significant drop in my bills.',\n",
       "   'In December, after finishing my experiment with gas, I turned my attention to electricity. The results were less remarkable.',\n",
       "   'I tested smart plugs from TP-Link, which offers a smartphone app to program the light switches and devices to turn on and off on a schedule. I also plugged in devices that were frequent offenders of so-called vampire energy, which suck power even when not in use. They included a large speaker, a laptop charger and a phone charger, for which I programmed the plugs to stay on only when I was likely to use them.',\n",
       "   'Over a few weeks, I studied my bills. The differences in energy costs were marginal.',\n",
       "   'That’s not to say we shouldn’t try to avoid wasting small amounts of power. But if your goal is to cut down on your bill, look elsewhere.',\n",
       "   'After the tests, I brought in Ms. Souza of Energineers, who toured my home for two hours and delivered the unfortunate news: There were major issues with my home’s “shell” — that is, the roof and walls.',\n",

TikTok, with its young-skewing active global user base of one billion, would seem a natural next frontier.',\n",

       "   '“Nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium, even copper — we already realized we need those metals for the green transition, for mitigating climate change,” said Bo Stensgaard, chief executive of Bluejay Mining, which is working on extracting nickel from a site in western Greenland in a venture with KoBold Metals, whose backers include Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. “When you see the geopolitical developments with Ukraine and Russia, it’s even more obvious that there are supply risks with these metals.”',\n",
       "   'But establishing new mining operations is likely to take years, even decades, because of the time needed to acquire permits and financing. In the meantime, companies using nickel — a group that also includes steel makers — will need to contend with higher prices, which will eventually be felt by consumers.',\n",
       "   'An average electric-car battery contains about 80 pounds of nickel. The surge in prices in March would more than double the cost of that nickel to $1,750 a car, according to estimates by the trading firm Cantor Fitzgerald.',\n",
       "   'Russia accounts for a relatively small proportion of world nickel production, and most of it is used to make stainless steel, not car batteries. But Russia plays an outsize role in nickel markets. Norilsk Nickel, also known as Nornickel, is the world’s largest nickel producer, with vast operations in Siberia. Its owner, Vladimir Potanin, is one of Russia’s wealthiest people. Norilsk is among a limited number of companies authorized to sell a specialized form of nickel on the London Metal Exchange, which handles all nickel trading.',\n",
       "   'Unlike other oligarchs, Mr. Potanin has not been a target of sanctions, and the United States and Europe have not tried to block nickel exports, a step that would hurt their economies as well as Russia’s. The prospect that Russian nickel could be cut off from world markets was enough to cause panic.',\n",
       "   'Analysts expect prices to come down from their recent peaks but remain much higher than they were a year ago. “The trend would be to come down to a level close to where we last left off,” around $25,000 a metric ton compared to the peak of $100,000 a ton, said Adrian Gardner, a principal analyst specializing in nickel at Wood Mackenzie, a research firm.',\n",
       "   'Nickel was on a tear even before the Russian invasion as hedge funds and other investors bet on rising demand for electric vehicles. The price topped $20,000 a ton this year after hovering between $10,000 and $15,000 a ton for much of the past five years. At the same time, less nickel was being produced because of the pandemic.',\n",
       "   'After Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, the price rose above $30,000 in a little over a week. Then came March 8. Word spread on the trading desks of brokerage firms and hedge funds in London that a company, which turned out to be the Tsingshan Holding Group of China, had made a huge bet that the price of nickel would drop. When the price rose, Tsingshan owed billions of dollars, a situation known on Wall Street as a short squeeze.',\n",
       "   'The price shot up to a little over $100,000 a ton, threatening the existence of many other companies that had bet wrong and prompting the London Metal Exchange to halt trading.',\n",
       "   'Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes\\xa0and spooking investors. The conflict has already caused\\u200b\\u200b dizzying spikes in energy prices,\\xa0and could severely affect various countries and industries.',\n",
       "   'The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion. \\xa0Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.',\n",
       "   'Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.',\n",
       "   'Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat;\\xa0together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.',\n",
       "   'Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.',\n",
       "   'Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions\\xa0intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.',\n",
       "   'The exchange tried to restart trading in nickel twice this week with new price limits, but sudden drops caused trading to halt once again. “The market is broken,” said Keith Wildie, the head of trading at the London-based metals firm Romco.',\n",
       "   'There is no sign that nickel prices will lead to factory shutdowns in the way that shortages of components made in Ukraine brought assembly lines at Volkswagen, BMW and other carmakers to a standstill. It will take a few weeks for price increases to ripple through the system.',\n",
       "   'For now, automakers and other big nickel buyers like steel makers may be able to find alternative suppliers, use more recycled material or switch to battery designs that require less nickel.',\n",
       "   '“There is enough nickel,” Ola Källenius, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, said in an interview this week. But carmakers might have to pay more, he said, adding, “It’s not unlikely that we will have secondary effects from this conflict.”',\n",
       "   \"The Ukraine conflict has underscored the urgency of moving away from fossil fuels, Mr. Duesmann of Audi said. Russian oil plays a much bigger role in the global economy than Russian nickel. “It would be too shortsighted to say, ‘Electromobility doesn’t work,'” he said.\",\n",

A pesar de que obtenemos funciones innecesarias que rara vez usamos, un celular es más que solo un teléfono para muchos de nosotros. Más bien, es una inversión en nuestra expectativa de cómo trabajaremos, nos mantendremos entretenidos y nos conectaremos con nuestros seres queridos. Algunos incluso estamos dispuestos a endeudarnos para conseguir lo que se ha convertido en un símbolo de estatus.',\n",

       "   'Solo cambias a un nuevo teléfono cuando realmente sientes que necesitas hacerlo.',\n",
       "   'En resumen, el iPhone más reciente es para aquellas personas que quieren un celular sin lujos que funciona bien y tiene un precio razonable. Si eres una de ellas; a continuación te presentamos lo que debes saber al respecto.',\n",
       "   'Para este iPhone económico, Apple tomó las mejores partes de sus iPhone más caros y las encajó en la carcasa de un modelo más antiguo con un botón de inicio y una pantalla más pequeña.',\n",
       "   'Comencemos con lo más destacado.',\n",
       "   'Como los iPhone más lujosos, el nuevo iPhone SE incluye conectividad 5G, la red celular más reciente. En mis pruebas del dispositivo en el área de la bahía de San Francisco, la velocidad de datos con la 5G fue hasta un 20 por ciento más rápida que con la 4G. Eso no es impresionante, pero es una buena función para tener a medida que las redes 5G se extienden.',\n",

Por eso, las aplicaciones y los juegos abrieron en un santiamén y corrieron de manera fluida.',\n",
       "   'La batería del iPhone SE fue otra fortaleza. La generación previa del teléfono, lanzada en 2020, tenía una batería por debajo del promedio que se agotaba alrededor de las 7:00 p. m. de cada día. Descubrí que el nuevo modelo tiene suficiente batería para durar hasta que sea hora de ir a dormir.',\n",

Esta conexión de datos, promovida en exceso por operadores como Verizon y AT&T, puede funcionar a una velocidad tan rápida que una película llega a descargarse en segundos.',\n",
       "   'El problema es que la tecnología 5G de onda milimétrica viaja pequeñas distancias y tiene problemas para penetrar muros y obstáculos. Lo que da como resultado que incluso sea poco común encontrar una conexión. Es probable que las personas que compren un iPhone SE ni siquiera se darán cuenta de lo que se están perdiendo.',\n",
       "   'La desventaja más evidente del iPhone más nuevo es la cámara. El lujoso sistema de cámara en los iPhone de mayor precio tiene lentes múltiples capaces de captar más luz.',\n",
       "   'En mis pruebas, el iPhone SE tomó fotografías claras y con colores vibrantes con luz de día, pero no se desempeñó igual de bien en condiciones lumínicas más desafiantes. En una fotografía de mis perros en un camino con sombras, el iPhone SE produjo una imagen con menos detalles y colores menos naturales en comparación con el iPhone 13 Mini de 700 dólares. La cámara del iPhone SE tampoco cuenta con el Modo Noche de los iPhone más caros para tomar fotografías en la oscuridad. Aunque se puede usar el “flash”.',\n",
       "   'La diferencia más clara fue la pantalla. La pantalla de 4,7 pulgadas del iPhone SE se sentía pequeña y parecía menos brillante en comparación con las de los modelos más caros, que tienen pantallas de 5,4 a 6,7 pulgadas. Es probable que esto haya sido el factor más distintivo; si tu vista no es muy buena o pasas mucho tiempo en la transmisión en directo de videos, tal vez prefieras una pantalla más grande.',\n",
       "   'Aunque hay algunos sacrificios que debes hacer cuando gastas menos en un teléfono inteligente, el nuevo iPhone tiene resultados más que satisfactorios. Los iPhone de más de 700 dólares son mejores, pero no un 60 por ciento mejores.',\n",
       "   'Vale la pena recordar que hay otros teléfonos que son fuertes contendientes en el rango de precio del iPhone SE. Entre ellos está el Pixel 5A de Google de 400 dólares, que tiene diferentes pros y contras. En mis pruebas, el celular de Google tiene una pantalla un poco más grande y toma mejores fotografías con poca luz. Sin embargo, el teléfono Pixel no fue tan rápido como el iPhone SE y quizá no dure tanto porque Google garantiza actualizaciones de software para el dispositivo solo hasta 2024.',\n",

To compensate, he has focused on driving during peak customer hours and tried to fill up at cheaper gas stations in the area around San Francisco where he works. He has also reduced his driving time from about 45 hours each week to roughly 20 hours.',\n",

       "   'Gig workers who drive for ride-hailing and delivery companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have been hit hard by rising gas prices, because their ability to earn money is tied directly to driving hundreds of miles each week. And because the drivers are contract workers, the companies do not reimburse them for the cost of fueling up.',\n",
       "   'Some drivers say that they have had enough, and that the added cost of gas is making an already difficult financial equation untenable. The national average price of a gallon of gas peaked at a record $4.33 last week, according to AAA. In California, where Mr. Potash lives, gas now averages $5.77 a gallon.',\n",
       "   '“High gas prices are the final nail in the coffin,” said Harry Campbell, who writes a blog called the Rideshare Guy and produces a podcast aimed at helping ride-hailing drivers. “Rising gas prices make a tough situation even tougher, and for a lot of drivers it’s sort of the final straw that pushes them over the edge.”',\n",
       "   'In a survey last week of 325 drivers who follow his content, Mr. Campbell found that 38 percent were driving less because of high gas prices and 15 percent had quit driving altogether. ',\n",

       "   'Uber and Lyft say the entirety of their new gas fees — 35 to 55 cents per trip for Uber and 55 cents for Lyft — will go to the drivers. But some drivers say the action is inadequate. Gas prices, on average, have increased 49 percent in the past year, according to AAA.',\n",

       "   'Tasty, which is part of the online media company BuzzFeed, called these “hands and pans” videos, and — I am not exaggerating — they helped shape the internet as we know it.',\n",
       "   'Today, Tasty’s DNA is in the TikTok food manias for baked feta pasta or pizza panini. People posting social media videos of hands-focused tasks like household cleaning and organizing owe a debt to Tasty. So did the 2020 social media craze of knives cutting into cake that looked like a Crocs shoe or a pickle. And broadly, Tasty and other 2010s food brands helped establish smartphone videos as a dominant way that we interact through screens.',\n",
       "   'Tasty’s influence might be everywhere online, but that doesn’t mean that it’s smooth sailing for Tasty itself.

       "   'Recently, Tasty has been overhauling its website, app and business strategy to go where our hyperactive tastes are going, with the flexibility to change course when we inevitably veer off in a different direction.',\n",
       "   'In its app, for example, Tasty is adding features to let people swap their own recipes, and it’s incorporating cook-along challenges for people to make meals virtually together. Bricker said that during the pandemic, people seemed to want more personal interactions and input rather than just to take recipes handed to them.',\n",
       "   'With so many online food videos on TikTok, Tasty is also teaming up with amateur video creators. In an arrangement with the delivery app Instacart, for example, dozens of TikTok creators will be able to post Tasty recipes within the TikTok app and then viewers have the option to buy the ingredients from Instacart’s app. Tasty has a similar arrangement with Walmart.',\n",

       "   'But a new paper, published Wednesday in Nature, calls into question whether much of this research is actually yielding valid findings. Many such studies, the paper’s authors found, tend to include fewer than two dozen participants, far shy of the number needed to generate reliable results.',\n",
       "   '“You need thousands of individuals,” said Scott Marek, a psychiatric researcher at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and an author of the paper. He described the finding as a “gut punch” for the typical studies that use imaging to try to better understand mental health.',\n",
       "   'Studies that use magnetic-resonance imaging technology commonly temper their conclusions with a cautionary statement noting the small sample size. But enlisting participants can be time-consuming and expensive, ranging from $600 to $2,000 an hour, said Dr. Nico Dosenbach, a neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine and another author on the paper. The median number of subjects in mental-health-related studies that use brain imaging is around 23, he added.',\n",
       "   'But the Nature paper demonstrates that the data drawn from just two dozen subjects is generally insufficient to be reliable and can in fact yield “massively inflated” findings,” Dr. Dosenbach said.',\n",
       "   'For their analysis, the researchers examined three of the largest studies using brain-imaging technology to reach conclusions about brain structure and mental health. All three studies are ongoing: the Human Connectome Project, which has 1,200 participants; the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development, or A.B.C.D., study, with 12,000 participants; and the U.K. Biobank study, with 35,700 participants.',\n",
       "   'The authors of the Nature paper looked at subsets of data within those three studies to determine whether smaller slices were misleading or “reproducible,” meaning that the findings could be considered scientifically valid.',\n",
       "   'For instance, the A.B.C.D. study looks, among other things, at whether thickness of the brain’s gray matter can be correlated to mental health and problem-solving ability. The authors of the Nature paper looked at small subsets within the big study and found that the subsets produced results that were unreliable when compared with the results yielded by the full data set.',\n",
       "   'On the other hand, the authors found, when results were generated from sample sizes involving several thousand subjects, the findings were similar to those from the full data set.',\n",

Time and again, the researchers found that subsets of data from fewer than several thousand people did not produce results consistent with those of the full data set.',\n",

       "   'Music was one of the first industries that felt the sonic boom of the internet, starting with song-sharing websites like Napster in the late 1990s and iTunes digital downloads later. This was thrilling for music lovers, but new ways to listen to and purchase (or not purchase) music pushed industry sales into a crater.',\n",

And many musicians and others say that they’re not sharing in the spoils from the digital transformation.',\n",
       "   'I wanted this newsletter to answer a direct question: Is the music industry an internet success story or not? There is no simple answer, which shows how messy it can be when technology jolts an industry, and it might take decades for all participants to feel like winners of the digital revolution — if that’s even possible.',\n",
       "   'First, I’ll lay out the case that the music industry is doing awesome. More than 500 million people around the world pay for digital music, mostly in fees for services such as Spotify, Apple Music or Tencent Music, which is based in China. Those services have given the industry something it has never had before: a steady stream of cash every month.',\n",
       "   'The industry also is making money a gazillion ways. When you watch a music video on YouTube, money flows to the people responsible for that song. TikTok pays record companies when videos feature their popular songs. Maybe more than for books, movies or other conventional entertainment sources, there has been a powerful symbiosis of social media and music that has lifted the popularity of both.',\n",

       "   'Ah, yes. The dark cloud. Revenue for the music industry has been increasing consistently since 2015, but revenue from all sources — including streaming subscriptions, CDs and royalties from elevator music — is still less than it was in 1999.',\n",

       "   'There aren’t an infinite number of people who are willing to pay the going rate in many countries of $10 a month to access a whole bunch of songs on their phones via a service like Spotify. That’s what worries people who believe the music industry’s digital success has peaked.',\n",
       "   'Ben also told me that there’s anxiety in the industry that even the biggest songs or albums aren’t as popular as hits once were. There may be so much music and other entertainment at our fingertips that each fresh song simply is not as attention-getting or valuable as music was even a decade ago.',\n",
       "   'Ben has also written that 99 percent of artists — the ones who aren’t as famous as Beyoncé — tend to say that millions of streams of their songs might translate into pennies for them. If the music industry is a success, but so many musicians feel like they’re missing out … is that really success?',\n",
       "   'The pessimists could be wrong. People have also been saying for years that Netflix couldn’t keep adding paying customers, but it has, and now the entire entertainment industry is copying its strategy. Many musicians are excited about newer ways to reach fans on their own terms, including through the website Bandcamp and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, which are essentially a way to transform a digital good into something one of a kind.',\n",

The Lobe platform allowed him to drag and drop sample photos and click a few buttons to make a system that could recognize his beloved bees and spot unwelcome visitors.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Cusack is part of a growing army of “citizen developers,” who use new products that allow anyone to apply artificial intelligence without having to write a line of computer code. Proponents of the “no-code” A.I. revolution believe it will change the world: It used to require a team of engineers to build a piece of software, and now users with a web browser and an idea have the power to bring that idea to life themselves.',\n",
       "   '“We are trying to take A.I. and make it ridiculously easy,” said Craig Wisneski, a no-code evangelist and co-founder of Akkio, a start-up that allows anyone to make predictions using data.',\n",
       "   'A.I. is following a familiar progression. “First, it’s used by a small core of scientists,” Jonathan Reilly, Akkio’s other co-founder, said. “Then the user base expands to engineers who can navigate technical nuance and jargon until, finally, it’s made user-friendly enough that almost anyone can use it.”',\n",
       "   'Just as clickable icons have replaced obscure programming commands on home computers, new no-code platforms replace programming languages with simple and familiar web interfaces. And a wave of start-ups is bringing the power of A.I. to nontechnical people in visual, textual and audio domains.',\n",
       "   'Juji, for example, is a tool designed to make building A.I. chatbots as easy as creating a PowerPoint presentation. It uses machine learning to automatically handle complex conversation flows and infer users’ particular characteristics to personalize each engagement rather than simply serving up preprogrammed interactions.',\n",
       "   'Its co-founder, Michelle Zhou, said the goal was to give Juji chatbots advanced human soft skills such as emotional intelligence so that they could connect with users on a more human level than existing systems have. Using Juji, staff members at the University of Illinois were able to create and manage their custom A.I. chatbot and scale their student recruitment operations.',\n",
       "   'But not all of the existing tools are robust enough to do more than simple tasks. Google’s Teachable Machines is a computer-vision tool similar to Lobe.ai. Steve Saling, a former landscape architect who is now living with A.L.S., worked with the Teachable Machines team for about a year and a half to train a system to turn switches on and off using his facial expressions.',\n",
       "   '“It gets more accurate with more data,” Mr. Saling said in an email. But he said the process of collecting that data — pictures of his face at different angles and in varying light — was labor intensive and the system never reached the level of accuracy required. “Automation needs to be in excess of 99 percent reliable to be dependent on it,” he said. “Teachable Machines will get there but it is not there yet.”',\n",
       "   'Still, it’s early days. “No-code A.I. tools are still on the fringes of the larger no-code movement, because not many people understand machine learning enough to dream up what’s possible,” said Josh Tiernan, who runs No Code Founders, a community of nontechnical entrepreneurs who use no-code tools such as WordPress or Bubble. But he expects no-code A.I. to grow as more people understand its potential.',\n",
       "   'Another force in no-code’s favor: Advances in A.I. itself are making no-code platforms more powerful. OpenAI, the company co-founded by Elon Musk, has a vast A.I. system, GPT-3, that can write code when prompted with simple English. It can even create websites and do other basic programming tasks. OpenAI has used the system to create GitHub Copilot, a tool that acts as an autocomplete function for coders, speeding up their work. DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has gone a step further with an A.I. tool capable of writing complete code to solve complex problems posed to it with normal speech or text.',\n",
       "   'Already, users of Microsoft’s Power Platform, which includes a family of no-code products, can generate simple applications by just describing them.',\n",
       "   '“I could say something like, ‘Look up all the customer records from the last year,’ and it will go do that for you automatically,” said Charles Lamanna, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of business apps and platforms. He estimates that half of all office work could be automated with A.I. if there were enough developers to do the work. “The only way to do this is to empower everybody to be a no-code developer.”',\n",
       "   'Eventually the broader public will be able to create A.I.-enabled software in much the same way that teenagers today can create sophisticated video effects that would have required a professional studio a decade or two ago.',\n",
       "   'For now, though, most no-code-A.I. users are business professionals who want to streamline the way things are done without having to involve a programmer.',\n",
       "   'Google’s AppSheet, for example, is an open platform where people can connect data and, with a single click, create apps that can be opened on a smartphone, tablet or computer. It uses A.I. to understand the intent of users and enables them to build mobile and desktop applications with integrated computer vision and predictive analytics features. It costs nothing to make apps for personal use.',\n",
       "   '“We’re focused on making this consumable by regular people,” said Praveen Seshadri, AppSheet’s co-founder and chief executive. There are many organizations around the world that have teams of people that need to coordinate schedules and tasks, he added. Each one is unique and more suited to building a custom app than trying to use something off the shelf.',\n",
       "   'As an example, he cited New Incentives, an organization that gives small amounts of cash to mothers in some of the poorest parts of Nigeria to encourage them to immunize their children. To track that data, they built an app with AppSheet that their employees now use in the field.',\n",

       "   'Mr. Soltani asked Scott Chaney, the executive director of the racing board, which oversees roughly 10 racetracks, about the ins and outs of running a small agency in California’s sprawling state government. They discussed how to handle remote work and hiring in the pandemic. Mr. Chaney also offered advice for navigating the public sector.',\n",

The office, the California Privacy Protection Agency, will be a more than 30-person group with a $10 million annual budget to help enforce the state’s privacy law, which is among the most stringent in the country.',\n",
       "   'But first the agency has to be built — and Mr. Soltani, 47, a privacy expert who once served as the Federal Trade Commission’s top technologist, has to overcome the lack of precedent. So he has reached out to groups not exactly adjacent to what his agency will be, like the racing board and others, for help navigating his new position.',\n",
       "   'He has already encountered challenges. He and his colleagues have received reams of feedback from industry lobbyists. They face questions from privacy activists about whether their budget is substantial enough to police the world’s largest companies. The board discussions need to be open to the public. And in the coming months, they must translate the feedback they have received into hard rules.',\n",
       "   '“It’s easily the most difficult thing I’ve done in my life, but also I think potentially the most impactful,” said Mr. Soltani, who has been working from his home in Oakland, Calif.',\n",
       "   'The new California agency reflects a larger shift in how the rules of the global internet are being set — and who is setting them. State capitals and foreign countries are increasingly taking a hands-on approach to limiting online data collection, curtailing the tech giants’ power and moderating extreme content on social media.',\n",
       "   'They are filling a vacuum left by Congress. Lawmakers from both parties have long said they would support a national privacy law. But negotiations in Washington have stalled, partly because of a dispute over whether a federal law should supersede state laws. California, Colorado and Virginia have enacted privacy laws. Utah passed a privacy bill this month and other states are considering their own proposals.',\n",

       "   'California’s Privacy Protection Agency stems from a 2018 state privacy law that gives residents the right to request their data from websites and have it deleted. The state attorney general was put in charge of creating rules under the law and suing companies that violated its terms. In 2020, privacy activists successfully campaigned to pass a ballot measure that added more provisions to the law and established the new agency to carry them out.',\n",
       "   '“We have the opportunity to protect privacy, understanding how that interacts with all of the innovative technologies that we’ve built here in California,” said Jennifer Urban, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, whom Gov. Gavin Newsom tapped to lead the new agency’s five-member board.',\n",

       "   'California’s approach will test whether having an agency solely for policing online privacy can make the United States a tougher regulator of tech giants.',\n",
       "   'Dedicated data protection agencies are the norm in Europe, where they enforce the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates how websites can collect data from users. But reviews of how these groups have enforced the law have been mixed. Critics have said European governments lack the resources to take on Google, Amazon and others.',\n",
       "   'California faces similar doubts. The new agency’s $10 million annual budget pales in comparison with Google’s $76 billion in profit last year. And many tech companies that could be in its sights are enmeshed in the state’s economic fortunes and political machinations.',\n",
       "   'The agency “will be subject to a certain amount of political pressure,” said Tracy Rosenberg, the executive director of the nonprofit Media Alliance, a Bay Area public interest group, who also works with Oakland Privacy, a community group. “We don’t really know how the governor and Legislature are going to react if there is pushback because of actions the agency takes.”',\n",
       "   'The agency’s proponents said its independence was protected in part by its structure, with unpaid board members appointed separately by different elected officials. Mr. Soltani described the initial funding as “like the ante in a poker game” because voters have “bought in” for at least $10 million, but said the Legislature could give more.',\n",
       "   'The agency’s first task will be to turn the state privacy law, which is broad, into detailed regulations for industry. That runs the gamut, from how data is used for targeted ads to more novel areas of the law, like how algorithms use personal information to make automated decisions. The law also demands that businesses adhere to the privacy preferences that online users set in their browsers; it is up to the agency to decide what that means in practice.',\n",

Privacy activists and industry groups have filed hundreds of pages of comments, trying to sway the agency’s decisions.

       "   'Angry over blackouts, wildfires caused by utilities and rising electricity bills, a small but growing number of Californians in rural areas and in the suburbs of San Francisco are going off the grid. They can do so because of a stunning drop in the cost of solar panels and batteries over the last decade. Some homeowners who have built new, off-grid homes say they have even saved money because their systems were cheaper than securing a new utility connection.',\n",
       "   'There have long been free spirits and survivalists who have lived off the grid. But the decline in solar and battery costs and growing frustrations with utilities appear to be laying the groundwork for more people to consider doing so.',\n",

Some energy experts say that millions of people could eventually go off the grid as costs drop. A fully off-grid system in California can run from $35,000 to $100,000, according to installers. At the low end, such systems cost roughly as much as an entry-level Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck.',\n",
       "   '“It’s not just the doomsayers or the eco-hippies,” said Diane Vukovic, who has researched the laws and regulations about going off the grid for Primal Survivor, an organization that helps consumers with disaster preparedness. “People want to have that self-reliance. It’s become so much cheaper and easier that at this point, there’s very little reason not to do it if you have the means to make the investment now.”',\n",
       "   'People going off the grid argue that utilities are not moving fast enough to address climate change and are causing other problems. In Northern California, Pacific Gas & Electric’s safety record has alienated many residents. The company’s equipment caused the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed dozens and destroyed the town of Paradise, about 70 miles north of Nevada City. The utility’s effort to prevent fires by cutting off power to homes and businesses has also angered people.',\n",

He said he never loses power, unlike PG&E customers. “I don’t think I’ll ever go back to being on the grid,” Mr. Savage said.',\n",
       "   'For people like him, it is not enough to take the approach favored by most homeowners with solar panels and batteries. Those homeowners use their systems to supplement the electricity they get from the grid, provide emergency backup power and sell excess energy to the grid.',\n",
       "   'The appeal of off-grid homes has grown in part because utilities have become less reliable. As natural disasters linked to climate change have increased, there have been more extended blackouts in California, Texas, Louisiana and other states.',\n",
       "   'Californians are also upset that electricity rates keep rising and state policymakers have proposed reducing incentives for installing solar panels on homes connected to the grid. Installing off-grid solar and battery systems is expensive, but once the systems are up and running, they typically require modest maintenance and homeowners no longer have an electric bill.',\n",
       "   'RMI, a research organization formerly known as the Rocky Mountain Institute, has projected that by 2031 most California homeowners will save money by going off the grid as solar and battery costs fall and utility rates increase. That phenomenon will increasingly play out in less sunny regions like the Northeast over the following decades, the group forecasts.',\n",

But Mr. Hochschild added that he was not convinced that such an approach made sense for most people. “We build 100,000 new homes a year in California, and I would guess 99.99 percent of them are connected to the grid,” he said.',\n",

That is because the excess electricity that rooftop solar panels produce will no longer reach the grid, where it can replace power from coal or natural gas plants. “We don’t need everybody to cut the cord and go it alone,” said Mark Dyson, senior principal with the carbon-free electricity unit of RMI.',\n",
       "   'Pepe Cancino moved from Santa Monica to Nevada County in 2020 after he and his wife, Diane, lost their jobs during the pandemic. They bought five acres with spectacular views of snow-capped mountains. Mr. Cancino, 42, a former home health care worker, picked up a chain saw and an ax and began learning how to build a house and generate his own power.',\n",
       "   'When they finish their two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom home this fall, the family, including their 15-year-old daughter, will generate electricity and use a well for water.',\n",

       "   'Some homeowners have lived without a grid connection for years but interest in cutting the cord surged after PG&E began to frequently use power shut-offs as a fire prevention tool in 2019, said Craig Griesbach, director of the Nevada County building department.',\n",
       "   'The county last year published a document to help homeowners go off the grid while complying with building codes. Mr. Griesbach said officials from as far as Los Angeles had contacted his office for advice on off-grid rules.',\n",

       "   'PG&E said homeowners in rural areas like Nevada County had always been more likely to go off the grid because extending power lines over long distances simply costs more.',\n",
       "   'A decade or two back, off-grid homes included a patchwork of solar panels, diesel or propane generators and lead acid batteries. A system that could run a furnace, a refrigerator and washer and dryer could cost well over $100,000.',\n",
       "   'Most current off-grid systems rely heavily on solar panels because their cost has fallen to less than $4 a watt from about $11.40 a watt in 2000, not including state and federal incentives, according the California Solar and Storage Association. Lithium-ion batteries weighing as little as 30 pounds, requiring minimal maintenance and costing $10,000 to $20,000 have replaced banks of lead acid batteries that used to cost tens of thousands of dollars, could weigh thousands of pounds and needed regular upkeep. Generators are often used but serve mostly as an emergency backup, as they do for homes connected to the grid, said Aaron Schroeder, who installed the systems used by the Cancinos.',\n",
       "   'Off-grid systems are particularly attractive to people building new homes. That’s because installing a 125- to 300-foot overhead power line to a new home costs about $20,000, according to the California Public Utilities Commission. In places where lines have to be buried, installation runs about $78,000 for 100 feet.',\n",

       "   'His plot sits just across the street from homes that are connected to PG&E. But the utility told him it would cost $100,000 for new electric service, and building a trench for the line, based on regulatory estimates, could add $300,000 or more. So he spent $300,000 after federal tax credits on solar panels and a large battery.',\n",
       "   'After a year of living in the house, Mr. Coekaerts, an executive at Oracle, is happy with his choice. While his neighbors on PG&E have lost power three times, he said, he hasn’t gone without it “even for a nanosecond.”',\n",

       "   'Electric cars available now aren’t designed to send power to homes. But newer models like the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Hyundai Ioniq 5 will have that ability, said Bill Powers, a San Diego engineer who plans to go off the grid with the help of an electric car. “The Holy Grail to me now is in electric vehicles.”']},\n",

       "   'As the owner of a Bored Ape, he now has commercial rights over the digital image to do with as he wishes. Many people choose to display their NFTs as their profile picture on social media accounts. ',\n",
       "   '(And if you’re wondering how ownership of a digital asset can be proven: Every NFT, or non-fungible token, has a distinct serial number, and the transaction history of each NFT is stored on the blockchain, so people can see who the real owner is.)',\n",
       "   'Mr. Pollak, 29, who bought three more a few months later, obtained these from a collection of 10,000 NFTs known as the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Some of the apes are wearing gold jackets or animal-print tunics. Others are smoking cigars or smiling widely. ',\n",
       "   'At the time, Mr. Pollak, who works for Genies, a tech start-up in Los Angeles that makes NFTs and avatars, didn’t have a lot of disposable income. “I was living in a four-bedroom townhouse with three other people,” he said. “We all shared a bathroom. It felt like college life.” ',\n",
       "   'He didn’t come from money, either. During the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Pollak said, when he was 16, his mother couldn’t pay the mortgage, so he and his family had to rent an apartment.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Pollak’s interest in NFTs was spurred by hearing people talk about them on Clubhouse. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is insane. I’m about to spend hundreds of dollars on a picture of a monkey,’” he said.',\n",
       "   'Turns out it was a wise decision. Last fall, several months after he had bought his first NFTs, Mr. Pollak’s apes skyrocketed in value. He sold one that he had bought for approximately 14 Ether (a virtual currency that was worth about $40,000 on the day of the purchase) for around 70 Ether (approximately $231,000 on the day of sale). ',\n",
       "   'He used the money for a down payment on a three-bedroom house in Los Angeles with a backyard. “We call it the Chimp Chalet,” he said, laughing. “I always wanted to own a house but never thought I could make it work.”',\n",
       "   'He now has three Bored Ape NFTs in his portfolio. He hasn’t sold them yet, but he will one day. For the first time in his life he feels financially well-off.',\n",
       "   'A fortunate handful of people now have their very own rags-to-riches stories thanks to NFTs. By investing in the right project at the right time, some collectors and digital artists have made “life-changing money,” said Matt Medved, a founder of Nft Now, a digital media publication about NFTs. Some are using the funds to pay off student loans, buy a home or quit jobs they hated. (Some people, of course, are also buying yachts or throwing lavish parties.)',\n",
       "   '“NFTs are like manna from heaven,” said Mr. Pollak, who also acknowledges how lucky he is. “I’ve heard horror stories of people spending their rent money on NFTs. It’s heartbreaking to see people risk their money when it doesn’t usually work out.”',\n",
       "   'Most people who make or buy NFTs never turn a profit. There is no regulation or consumer protection, and trading them is basically as risky as gambling. Investing in cryptocurrency is high risk and involves a lot of technical know-how and luck; few financial professionals would recommend it, and scams are aplenty.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Medved encourages people to think of NFTs like baseball cards. “For generations our society has accepted that rare baseball cards have value,” he said. “There is a rare Mickey Mantle card that probably costs 5 cents to make that sold for $5.2 million last year. And why? It’s not about the physical piece of card stock. It’s the history, the rarity, the scarcity, the cultural relevance.”',\n",
       "   '“It comes down to fandom,” he added.',\n",
       "   'Similarly, what many NFT artists create or collectors invest in will be worth little or nothing in the long term. But there are a few NFTs that have become very valuable and have earned their owners and creators a vast sum of money in a short period of time.',\n",
       "   'The Bored Apes that Mr. Pollak bought, for example, could be minted — i.e. go to market — at .08 Ether ($200 last spring). Now, less than a year later, the cheapest one is worth about 73 Ether (about $190,000). (Ether can be converted to cash on major cryptocurrency platforms like Coinbase and Gemini and then transferred to a bank account.)',\n",
       "   'Claire Silver, an artist in her early 30s who works with artificial intelligence, is another NFT success story. In 2017, she was given three CryptoPunks, a collection of 10,000 unique pixel art characters generated from an algorithm, by someone she met on Slack. ',\n",
       "   '“I was in a chat room about cryptocurrency, and I met this guy who was interested in art,” said Ms. Silver, who lives a nomadic lifestyle but most recently lived in Denver. He told her he had 730 CryptoPunks, she said, “and asked if I wanted three. I said, ‘Sure.’”',\n",
       "   'In 2017, collectors could claim CryptoPunks for free as long as they had an Etherum wallet. Now the cheapest one is selling for around 68 Ether (almost $175,000).',\n",
       "   'She held on to hers until 2020 when she heard rumblings that they were selling for a lot of money. She sold one in July 2021 for about $60,000 and still has two others. (Many are selling for six figures. One sold last month for almost $600,000.) ',\n",
       "   'Ms. Silver also makes her own NFTs. She, like all NFT artists, earns money from the original sale and may receive 10 percent of every secondary sale. One of her pieces sold for 15 Ether ($63,000 at the time).',\n",
       "   'She has saved so much that she finally feels financially secure, at least for now. “This amount of money is a big deal to me because I come from poverty. We had to accept church donations for food growing up,” she said. “The other day I walked into Walmart and was like, ‘I can buy the cheese, I can buy the good coffee.’ I had never experienced that freedom before.” ',\n",
       "   'She recently returned from a trip to Britain, where Sotheby’s was auctioning her work, and has a trip planned to Japan. ',\n",
       "   'This month she is even giving her mother a house, which she paid for in all cash. “I got one of those big red bows, and I am going to stick it on the front door like in those commercials,” she said. “I have been wanting to do something like this for my mom since I was a little kid.”',\n",

On Twitter and other social media, he pressured Apple, Google, Netflix, Intel, PayPal and others to stop doing business in Russia. He helped form a group of volunteer hackers to wreak havoc on Russian websites and online services. His ministry also set up a cryptocurrency fund that has raised more than $60 million for the Ukrainian military.',\n",

       "   'In his first in-depth interview since the invasion began on Feb. 24, Mr. Fedorov said his goal was to create a “digital blockade” and to make life so unpleasant and inconvenient for Russian citizens that they would question the war. He praised companies that had pulled out of Russia, but said Apple, Google and others could go further with steps such as completely cutting off their app stores in the country.',\n",

       "   'The new dinner time is an inconvenience because the last of the company’s shuttles that take employees to and from their homes typically leaves the office at 6 p.m. It will also make it more difficult for workers to stock up on hefty to-go boxes of food and bring them to their refrigerators at home.',\n",

Now it is undergoing dramatic changes as its user growth stalls and younger competitors like TikTok gain traction worldwide.

Wait until war breaks out, and authoritarians start seizing assets and imposing capital controls on their citizens. Wait until big banks and tech companies start censoring dissidents for their political views. Then you’ll see why we need a stateless, decentralized, anonymous digital currency.',\n",
       "   'More than most cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin was seen by many of its libertarian-leaning fans as a kind of doomsday insurance, a form of “digital gold” that would be a source of stability as the world grew more chaotic and unpredictable.',\n",

In the United States, inflation is rising at the fastest pace in decades, and the VIX — the so-called fear index used by Wall Street to measure expected volatility in the stock market — has risen more than 80 percent this year. Last month, Canada’s government responded to the threat of a protest convoy of anti-vaccine truckers by threatening to freeze their bank accounts, drawing calls for a type of money that isn’t subject to government seizures. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was met with brutal sanctions that have tanked the ruble and devastated the Russian economy, and many U.S. companies have pulled out of Russia, making it nearly impossible for its citizens to access their bank accounts, use credit cards or even post on social media.',\n",

       "   'Day-to-day usage of cryptocurrencies isn’t picking up the way you’d expect, either. Bitcoin trading volume rose after Russia invaded Ukraine, but it has remained relatively flat since, suggesting that people aren’t rushing to trade their rubles and hryvnia (Ukraine’s currency) for digital currencies. Russian oligarchs don’t appear to be using crypto to evade sanctions en masse, either, despite initial fears that they might.',\n",
       "   'Granted, crypto has not been totally absent from these events. In Canada, some truckers raised money through crypto donations (while others had their crypto wallets seized as part of the crackdown), and Ukraine’s government has reportedly raised nearly $100 million in crypto donations. And it’s still too early to say, with certainty, that crypto won’t be useful in later stages of the Russian conflict.',\n",
       "   'But Bitcoin doesn’t seem to be playing a central role in our global unraveling so far. Which raises the obvious question: Why not?',\n",
       "   'One possibility is that crypto is still too confusing and too difficult for normal people to use, especially during a war. Internet access is spotty in many parts of Ukraine, and reports have suggested that even the country’s elites are struggling to convert their assets into crypto.',\n",
       "   'Another possibility, popular among skeptics of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is that Bitcoin is still too volatile to be useful as a hedge against economic and political instability.',\n",
       "   '“The Bitcoin and crypto communities have been selling a false narrative all these years that Bitcoin is supposed to be a safe haven from the traditional financial markets,” said Jimmy Nguyen, the president of the Bitcoin Association, a cryptocurrency trade group. (His group promotes a Bitcoin spinoff, Bitcoin SV, that sees itself as a more useful version of the cryptocurrency.)',\n",

       "   'Kevin Werbach, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, floated a different theory. Bitcoin’s earliest and most vocal adopters, he said, tended to be libertarians who saw cryptocurrency as a kind of insurance policy against hyperinflation and government corruption. But the more recent price swings in the crypto markets attracted a surge of speculators who viewed Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mainly as investments, and cared less about their political implications.',\n",
       "   '“There’s a tremendous amount of rhetoric around Bitcoin in particular that suggests that it’s predominantly a means of escaping from the government-issued fiat currency system,” he said. “And yet most of the activity, according to basically every rigorous study that’s been done, is predominantly people speculating.”',\n",

       "   'Putin does not want direct negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly called for direct negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the hope of ending the war, but Mr. Putin does not think the time is right for talks, according to a senior Turkish official.',\n",
       "   'Another possible explanation for Bitcoin’s underperformance, which was floated by Joe Weisenthal at Bloomberg, is that chaos cuts both ways, and that the same events that could be seen as “good for Bitcoin” in the short term — inflation, sanctions, geopolitical conflict — could also be bad for Bitcoin over the long term, since they could draw the attention of regulators.',\n",

       "   'Ms. St. John is one of dozens of entrepreneurs, small businesses and corporations that Apple has gone after in recent years for applying to trademark names with the word “apple” or logos of stemmed fruit. Between 2019 and last year, Apple, the world’s most valuable public company, worth $2.6 trillion, filed 215 trademark oppositions to defend its logo, name or product titles, according to the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit watchdog. That’s more than the estimated 136 trademark oppositions that Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google collectively filed in the same period, the group said.',\n",
       "   'Apple is a more common word than corporate names like Microsoft or Google, and the high rate stems partly from that. Many copycats, particularly in China, have also tried drafting off Apple’s name or logo in the tech and entertainment industries to make a buck.',\n",

Before 2000, it filed just a handful of trademark oppositions each year, peaking at nine in 1989, according to the Tech Transparency Project. At least one of those oppositions was to an electronics retailer that sold computer parts under the name “Pineapple.”',\n",

In 1978, Apple Corps, the holding company founded by the Beatles, sued Apple Computer for trademark infringement, the first salvo in a series of legal disputes between the two companies over the ensuing decades. In 2007, the two Apples finally agreed to give the Silicon Valley company all of the trademarks related to “Apple.”',\n",

The other was to Big Apple Curry, a New York City Indian cooking blog, over its name. In Apple’s filings against them, whole sections were copied word for word to establish the company’s brand value — “an estimated valuation of $206 billion” by Forbes in 2019 — and its “extraordinary level of fame and consumer recognition.”',\n",

The shaking quickly overwhelmed the seismometer, an education instrument installed at a high school, and it recorded little useful data.',\n",
       "   'Weeks passed before foreign seismic experts could travel to the disaster area, and then months passed before the portable seismometers they installed recorded enough of the fading aftershocks to shed light on the fault that had ruptured.',\n",

But several small, inexpensive instruments run by citizen scientists managed to capture the seismic waves, giving researchers a much quicker view of where the Earth had broken deep underground and demonstrating the value of enlisting the enthusiasm of curious nonexperts for science. (The earthquake’s death toll was about 2,200 people, much lower than the one in 2010, largely because the epicenter was in a more rural part of the country.)',\n",
       "   '“In 2021, we had that information in real time,” said Eric Calais, a geophysicist at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris who has studied the tectonics of the Caribbean for more than 30 years. “So that’s a big difference.”',\n",
       "   'Writing in an article published on Thursday in the journal Science, Dr. Calais and his colleagues described what the citizen science seismometers revealed about the August earthquake. About 40 miles of the same fault that caused the devastating 2010 earthquake ruptured, but farther to the west. The data also revealed some surprises, Dr. Calais said: At the eastern end of this segment, the fault was not vertical, where two tectonic plates are sliding past each other. Instead, the two plates were also being pushed together, with the northern one sliding on top of the southern one.',\n",
       "   '“If we hadn’t had the aftershock distribution, then we would not have been able to put in our models the proper full geometry,” Dr. Calais said. “Then our assessment of what went on would have been wrong.”',\n",
       "   'The Caribbean is sometimes a zone of overlooked seismic dangers with active volcanoes and earthquake faults. “The Caribbean is its own small-scale Ring of Fire,” said Susan E. Hough, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. “It’s like the Pacific Rim on a smaller scale.”',\n",
       "   'But the tectonic plates are crashing together at a slower pace, and major earthquakes occur less often. The second half of the 20th century was pretty quiet in the region. “People got kind of complacent about it,” Dr. Hough said. “The 2010 earthquake didn’t surprise any earthquake professionals in the world, but it surprised a lot of people that weren’t aware of the scientific results.”',\n",
       "   'Dr. Hough and Dr. Calais were two of the earthquake experts who traveled to Haiti in 2010. In the aftermath of the quake that year, international organizations provided financing to set up conventional seismometers, which cost tens of thousands of dollars each, in Haiti. When the magnitude-7.2 earthquake hit on Aug. 14, none of Haiti’s conventional seismometers were working, although a seismometer at the United States embassy was gathering data.',\n",
       "   '“It turns out to just be difficult, if not impossible, to run a conventional kind of state-of-the-art seismic network in Haiti,” Dr. Hough said. “They don’t have a functional power grid, for example, let alone reliable internet everywhere.”',\n",
       "   'Haiti remains politically unstable, suffers from widespread poverty and is vulnerable to natural disasters. The president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated the month before the August quake. A couple of days after the earthquake, a tropical storm, Grace, passed over the island.',\n",
       "   'In 2018, at a seismology conference in Malta, Dr. Calais met Branden Christensen, the chief executive of Raspberry Shake, a company based in Panama that combines a small, cheap computer called a Raspberry Pi with a small, cheap device used widely by the oil and natural gas industries to measure tiny ground motions, creating a seismometer that cost a few hundred dollars instead of tens of thousands of dollars.',\n",
       "   'The Raspberry Shake devices, smaller than a breadbox, can measure minute ground movements, although over a smaller range of frequencies than modern conventional seismometers can. But they do not need to be anchored to the ground and require only a power outlet and an internet connection.',\n",
       "   '“I immediately thought that the level of simplicity of the device was such that it would have a better chance of survival in the long term in Haiti, meaning no maintenance,” Dr. Calais recalled. He used some leftover grant money to buy five of them, and, with colleagues in Haiti, he started looking for volunteers who would be willing to put one in their home or office. The network has since expanded to about 15 devices.',\n",
       "   'Dr. Calais said the Haiti data shows that while the Raspberry Shakes were not as capable as conventional seismometers, they nonetheless made scientifically valuable measurements. “They are able to do the job when it comes to recording even small aftershocks,” he said.',\n",
       "   'The Raspberry Shakes, however, are not immune to Haiti’s infrastructure limitations. Only one of the three near the epicenter was operational when the main earthquake struck last August.',\n",
       "   'The instrument closest to the epicenter was offline, because the host had let his internet service lapse. But he renewed it right after he felt the shaking. “We have to accept this kind of issue,” Dr. Calais said. “Internet and power are never a given in Haiti.”',\n",
       "   'The researchers were also able to add three Raspberry Shakes to the area, and all six measured more than a thousand aftershocks that followed in the weeks afterward.',\n",
       "   'The seismic data, published online, is only part of Dr. Calais’s motivation for setting up the Raspberry Shake network. It is also meant to spread knowledge about earthquake hazards among the volunteers hosting the Raspberry Shakes and other people in Haiti.',\n",

More than 1,600 devices report their data to the company’s website. “They’re popping up all over the place,” Mr. Christensen said.',\n",

In a paper published in Science in July 2020, scientists used data from 300 seismic stations, including 65 Raspberry Shakes, to observe a global quieting of noise from trains, planes, factories and other human-made sources as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.',\n",

But on Thursday, the company reported a big increase in the greenhouse gases emanating from its operations and its products, a reminder of the challenges that companies face as they try to clean up their businesses.',\n",
       "   'Microsoft’s carbon emissions were up 21.5 percent in the 12 months through June 2021, after small declines in 2020 and 2019. The increase was almost entirely driven by emissions from energy used to build data centers and make devices — like the Xbox and the Surface tablet — and from the power that Microsoft estimates its products consume when people used them.',\n",
       "   'Microsoft has sought to show that with committed leaders and sufficient funding, companies can effectively reduce their net emissions to zero in the coming years, bolstering international efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures. But the surge in Microsoft’s emissions suggests that it and other companies may have trouble meeting their goals. And since the increase resulted from strong demand for products, it is a reminder that robust business growth can often mean pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.',\n",
       "   'Still, Microsoft’s leaders say they can be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade, by cutting emissions and using a variety of measures to remove carbon from the atmosphere. “We’re still absolutely committed to — and absolutely sure of our ability to meet — our 2030 commitment,” said Lucas Joppa, Microsoft’s chief environmental officer.',\n",
       "   'Many large companies have some sort of plan to cut their emissions, and they face pressure from shareholders to do more. Investors have also pressed oil and gas companies to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy.',\n",
       "   'Microsoft is the first large tech company to report this year on the progress of its sustainability efforts. Apple, Google and Facebook’s parent, Meta, all aim to get their net carbon emissions to zero by 2030. Amazon, which has a large delivery network and much more extensive supply chains, has a 2040 goal to do the same.',\n",
       "   '“None of this is going to be easy for any company — decarbonization is a challenge,” said Laura Draucker, a director at Ceres, a nonprofit group that works with investors and companies to address environmental challenges. But when large tech companies like Microsoft report setbacks on their emissions, she added, it should prompt them to press jointly for policies that promote “affordable, equitable access to clean energy.”',\n",
       "   '“It doesn’t have any impact on their competitive advantage,” she added.',\n",
       "   'In a new move, Microsoft indicated on Thursday that it would no longer do specialized work for energy companies involved in extracting fossil fuels unless they had a “net zero” target. The term means having no carbon emissions overall, a goal companies typically hope to achieve through a combination of emissions reductions and carbon removal.',\n",
       "   'And Dr. Joppa said the recent disruptions in the oil and gas markets had not convinced him of the need to slow the move toward renewable sources of energy. “I would say that I have not seen anything that convinces me that we should do anything other than continue to go faster,” he said.',\n",
       "   'Microsoft is also active in pressing its climate agenda beyond its own business. When the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the public for input on how corporate climate change disclosures might be standardized, Microsoft said it would support the commission’s development of such disclosure rules.',\n",
       "   'Government moves to push companies to adopt climate policies could meet some resistance in Washington — especially since the spike in energy prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to calls to step up oil and gas production.',\n",
       "   '“Private companies are free to pursue net-zero policies regardless of their sense — as long as they’re following the law, this isn’t a matter of public policy,” said Katie Tubb, senior policy analyst for energy and environment at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group, in an email. “Of greater concern are policymakers trying to use the force of government to pressure or even require such efforts in the private sector.”',\n",
       "   'In theory, Microsoft’s huge profits give it the means to achieve its goals. And the company has had success cutting emissions from its own operations and from the electricity that powers those operations, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in industry jargon. These fell 17 percent in the 12 months through June, and with greater purchases of clean power and efficiency measures, the company aims to get those emissions down to near zero by 2025, a goal that Dr. Joppa said Microsoft still expect to achieve.',\n",
       "   'Much harder is reducing Scope 3 emissions — those from a company’s supply chains and its customers. Microsoft’s Scope 3 emissions are nearly 50 times as large as Scopes 1 and 2 combined, and they rose 23 percent in the year through June, after small declines in previous years. The jump came from three main sources: energy used to build data centers; power consumed by suppliers; and energy expended when customers used Microsoft devices, which ballooned as the pandemic drove Xbox use.',\n",
       "   'Even so, Microsoft aims to more than halve its Scope 3 emissions by 2030. The company said on Thursday that it was working to reduce carbon emissions from construction and to make its devices more energy efficient.',\n",
       "   'And by removing millions of tons of carbon a year from the air, Microsoft hopes to reduce its total emissions to zero or lower on a net basis by the end of the decade.',\n",
       "   'One important factor will be the rapid development of carbon removal technologies, which are operating on a small scale and are expensive. Reforestation is currently Microsoft’s main method of carbon removal. The company said it had contracts for 2.5 million metric tons of carbon removal, but that represents only 18 percent of its carbon emissions in the year through June. Dr. Joppa said Microsoft could meet its goals even if technology that removed carbon directly from the air did not work.',\n",

       "  'ArticleText': ['It would probably be a stretch to say that Ty Haney changed the way we work out. She didn’t start a boutique fitness craze; she’s not Jane Fonda. But Outdoor Voices, the athleisure company she founded in 2014, helped to popularize a fitness paradigm that has more to do with everyday movement than the body-stressing athleticism advertised by brands like Nike.',\n",
       "   'Outdoor Voices built a following with color-blocked compression leggings and all-in-one exercise dresses that could easily transition from gym to brunch. On social media, fans boasted about buying items in every shade and posted pictures of themselves #DoingThings in scenic locales while wearing matching sets. They also shared feedback on new styles and colorways in online forums. It was a customer-loyalty fairy tale.',\n",
       "   'Though she is no longer with Outdoor Voices, Ms. Haney, 33, is hoping to bring its tenets of community building and consumer engagement into a new sphere: the blockchain-based future of the internet known as web3. She’s betting that in the next phase of online retail, “minting things” will be the new “doing things.”',\n",
       "   'Her latest venture, a platform called Try Your Best, will enable brands to collect input from customers in exchange for rewards such as digital collectibles (NFTs) and brand coins that can be used for bragging rights or toward purchases. These are assets, Ms. Haney said, that could potentially have lasting value, as opposed to the one-time discount codes and fleeting perks most companies offer loyalists.',\n",
       "   '“The idea is that brands and fans build together, and the concept is to share value with those who create it,” Ms. Haney said in an interview.',\n",
       "   'Direct-to-consumer brands have typically relied on disparate sources to solicit feedback from their most engaged customers: Google Docs, Slack bases, DMs. Try Your Best aims to streamline that process, and to route marketing dollars away from Facebook and Instagram, where Ms. Haney said that soaring costs have made it harder for emerging brands to grow.',\n",
       "   'So far, 10 brands have signed up for Try Your Best’s pilot program, the company said, including Hill House Home, whose “nap dresses” became the height of pandemic loungewear, and Vada, a jewelry and eyewear company. But at the start, the only brand on the platform will be Joggy, a new brand led by Ms. Haney that sells products containing CBD and THCV.',\n",
       "   'She said that Try Your Best hopes to reach “the Parade customer, the JuneShine customer, the Glossier customer — these millennial, Gen Z-type audiences.”',\n",
       "   'The target users are “the people who buy a brand because they love it and post about it on Instagram,” said Sean Judge, a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, which specializes in blockchain-related investments and put $2 million into Try Your Best — a modest figure compared with Outdoor Voices’ fund-raising. “This is a way for them to connect with others in that community and also have a direct relationship with brands to provide real-time feedback around new product ideas and where the brand should head.”',\n",
       "   'Ms. Haney said that involving consumers in design decisions helped drive the success behind some of Outdoor Voices’s most popular products. “The way that we got people to buy every color — 25 colors — of the exercise dress was by bringing them upstream in the product creation process,” she said, but “there was really no centralized tool for this type of interaction.”',\n",
       "   'Casey Lewis, a trend researcher who writes about youth culture in her Substack newsletter, After School, was intrigued by the idea of brands rethinking customer loyalty but circumspect about the appeal of digital assets.',\n",
       "   '“Any time a brand can successfully build a community, it’s a huge win for them. But it’s so, so hard to manufacture or force that success,” Ms. Lewis said. “The biggest question is: Do people care about NFTs, and will that be enough to get them involved and excited?”',\n",
       "   'Web3 has been billed, often in vague and utopian terms, as an online ecosystem where users will wrest power from the tech behemoths that dominate the current phase of the internet, Web 2.0.',\n",
       "   'Kevin Werbach, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the author of “The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust,” said that while “granting strong ownership rights directly to users” could potentially shift the balance of power, none of web3’s promises are guaranteed.',\n",
       "   '“There’s a web3 that’s out there which is wonderful and trying to make the world a better place, but just by labeling something web3, it doesn’t mean power dynamics will magically reverse,” Professor Werbach said.',\n",
       "   'Ms. Haney is especially interested in bringing women into web3. “We’re seeing a predominantly male demo on Reddit and in Discords, telling each other about all of these opportunities,” she said. “By bringing brands that do have a large female audience base into crypto, that’s a really big opportunity.”',\n",
       "   'Try Your Best runs on the Avalanche blockchain, which Ms. Haney said she chose in part because its transactions use significantly less energy than, say, Bitcoin or Ethereum. (Even supposedly “green” mining operations, however, are much more energy intensive than other financial transactions.)',\n",
       "   'Try Your Best plans to make money by collecting a monthly fee from brands and potentially sharing in revenue when tokens were used to drive sales.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Judge, the investor, previously worked with a range of direct-to-consumer companies, and heard constant frustration from them about the escalating costs of advertising to customers on Facebook and Instagram. Ms. Haney “experienced these pain points firsthand,” he said.',\n",
       "   'Outdoor Voices was a huge success. Ms. Haney and the company were the subject of a glowing feature in The New Yorker that compared Outdoor Voices to Lululemon, and it raised more than $50 million in venture capital. It also attracted the attention of Mickey Drexler, the retail legend who led transformations at Gap and J. Crew. He became chairman of the board and drew investors to the brand.',\n",

       "   'But just before the pandemic hit the United States, Ms. Haney’s successful run at Outdoor Voices came to a screeching halt as investors questioned her leadership. A schism had opened between the young founder and Mr. Drexler, costly store openings were delayed, and a string of experienced retail executives left the company, which struggled with a relocation to Austin, Texas, from New York. The internal troubles were detailed in articles in The New York Times and BuzzFeed News.',\n",
       "   'Ms. Haney recalled thinking at the time, “My life is going to be over.”',\n",
       "   'But as the news cycle moved on, so did she. “It sucked but it didn’t kill me, and it gave me that much more energy to go build again and show I can set vision and execute against it,” she said. “It feels good to take full accountability.”',\n",
       "   'Ms. Haney resigned from the brand in the investor tumult in February 2020 and then rejoined two months later with the title founder. In January 2021, she left the company and the board to pursue projects including Try Your Best. She still retains a stake in Outdoor Voices.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Judge was not concerned with Ms. Haney’s tussle with investors at Outdoor Voices, and viewed it as a vote of confidence that several former employees of the firm have since joined her at Try Your Best.',\n",
       "   '“There’s challenges with every type of business, and some are more public than others,” Mr. Judge said. “I think Ty learned an incredible amount about building a business.”',\n",
       "   'Ms. Haney said that her start-up is arriving at a time when the traditional direct-to-consumer model — which has built businesses like Warby Parker, Everlane and Glossier — is “broken” after years of overreliance on social marketing.',\n",
       "   'At one point, she said, Outdoor Voices was devoting about 30 percent of its total funding to acquiring customers on Facebook and Instagram. She’s hoping Try Your Best can help brands lower those costs.',\n",
       "   'Separately, as younger people may be less willing to hand over their thoughts and time for free, Try Your Best offers an answer to the question of how to pay them back.',\n",
       "   '“One thing with Gen Z is they want to be rewarded for their input and advice,” Ms. Lewis said. “This is not a generation who is willing to do things just for the heck of it.”']},\n",

But in Russia, the country’s propaganda machine was busy churning out a deluge of misinformation aimed at its own citizens.',\n",
       "   'The narrative disseminated online through state-run and unofficial channels has helped create an alternate reality where the invasion is justified and Ukrainians are to blame for violence. To control the narrative at home, Russia also shut down access to several websites and threatened the news media with long prison sentences for criticizing the war. There’s some evidence that the effort has mollified at least some Russians.',\n",

       "   'Neo-Nazis have been a recurring character in Russian propaganda campaigns for years, used to falsely justify military action against Ukraine in what Russian officials have called “denazification.” Those claims have\\xa0only continued during the conflict.

       "   'Russian social media accounts have used a mix of fake and unconfirmed photos showing Ukrainian soldiers holding Nazi flags or photos of Hitler. An analysis by the Center for Information Resilience, a nonprofit focused on identifying disinformation, showed that the number of tweets connecting Ukrainians to Nazis soared after the invasion began.',\n",

They added that Ukrainians set fire to an adjacent building before fleeing, providing no evidence. Western experts said controlling the Zaporizhzhia complex would allow Russia to trigger blackouts or shut down the entire power grid.',\n",

Pigs are expressive animals with a wide range of vocalizations, according to Stewart Skinner, 38, a co-owner of the farm. Interpreting their calls can occasionally stump even experienced farmers.',\n",
       "   '“I have often joked that this job would be far easier if we could speak pig,” Mr. Skinner said.',\n",
       "   'Decoding the emotions behind those oinks could soon become a little easier. Researchers in Europe have created an algorithm that assesses pigs’ emotional states based on the sound the animals make.',\n",
       "   '“Animal welfare is nowadays widely accepted to be based not only on the physical health of animals, but also their mental health,” said Elodie Briefer, an associate professor of biology at the University of Copenhagen and an author of the study published this week in the journal Scientific Reports. The sooner a farmer can discern whether an animal is pleased or distressed, the faster any issues in the animal’s environment that may affect its health can be addressed.',\n",
       "   'Pigs are among the more voluble of domestic animals, producing a wider range of sounds more frequently than relatively taciturn goats, sheep and cows. To crack the code of pig communication, scientists in five research labs across Europe used hand-held microphones to gather roughly 7,400 distinct calls from 411 individual pigs. The calls were recorded during all types of situations in the life span of a pig, from birth to the slaughterhouse.',\n",
       "   'Researchers then assigned each sound a positive or negative emotional value based on what the paper calls “intuitive inference.” In other words, researchers made an educated guess about how the pig likely felt about the event at which the sound was recorded (i.e. feeding, good; castration, bad).',\n",
       "   'Upon first listen, most people tend to do slightly better than chance at guessing a pig’s feelings based on its sound alone. Listen closely to enough pig calls, though, and patterns emerge.',\n",
       "   'Grunts associated with positive emotions — the sounds pigs make when feeding, running or reuniting with their mothers or littermates after a separation — tend to be shorter, and have a one-note consistency in tone.',\n",
       "   'Unsurprisingly, an unhappy pig sounds awful. Situations that produced cries of distress included being inadvertently crushed by a mother sow (a common peril for piglets), awaiting slaughter, hunger, fights and the unwelcome surprise of strange people or objects in their pens. The screams, squeals and barks recorded from animals experiencing fear or pain are both longer in duration and more variable in tone than the sounds of contentment.',\n",
       "   'When taught to listen for these simple distinctions, humans do a better job of accurately interpreting an animal’s emotional state, Dr. Briefer said. But artificial intelligence performed best of all. The researchers’ algorithm, designed by co-author Ciara Sypherd, correctly identified the animal’s emotion as positive or negative 92 percent of the time.',\n",
       "   'The study is the product of SoundWel, a project sponsored by the European Union to improve animal health and welfare. Researchers with the project are now looking to partner with an engineer who can incorporate their data into an app or other tool that farmers could use to interpret their animals’ calls, and emotional state, in real time, Dr. Briefer said.',\n",
       "   'Understanding animals’ emotions has practical and legal consequences. Animal sentience laws like the one currently before Britain’s parliament assert that animals are capable of thought and feeling, and that the government must take their welfare into account when making policies that might affect them. The European Union recognized animal sentience in 2009.',\n",

       "   'But that would change on March 5. Jason Russell, a founder of the nonprofit Invisible Children, had directed a film called “Kony 2012” that was meant to expose a violent crisis.',\n",
       "   '“We felt if people in the Western world knew about this atrocity, it’d stop in days,” Mr. Russell, 43, said in a phone interview.',\n",
       "   'In the video, released on YouTube by Invisible Children, Mr. Russell explains the conflict in simple terms suited for his 5-year-old son, Gavin, who appears in the video alongside inspirational images of defiant Ugandan children and activists in North America. At the end, Mr. Russell issues a call to action: for celebrities, policymakers and anyone else watching to help make Joseph Kony a household name.',\n",
       "   'When Oprah Winfrey tweeted “Kony 2012,” its views rose from 66,000 to nine million, according to Gilad Lotan, a data scientist who compiled a visual analysis of its spread. Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Kim Kardashian shared it, too. Within a week, the video had hit 100 million — a record on YouTube at the time — and Mr. Kony had become the target of a global civilian manhunt.',\n",
       "   'Ten years on, Mr. Kony remains at large, Gavin has started high school, and Mr. Russell is still grappling with the mixed legacy of “Kony 2012.” At a time when a constant stream of videos on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter is illustrating the real-time destruction of Ukrainian cities by Russian forces, the film reads as both a relic of what experts have described as a techno-optimistic post-Arab Spring digital landscape and a precursor to an era of seemingly endless footage of violence and conflict on social media.',\n",
       "   'Invisible Children, which was founded in 2004 by Mr. Russell, Bobby Bailey and Laren Poole, had screened films about Mr. Kony and his rebel group, the Lord’s Resistance Army, at events around the country, reaching a total of five million viewers, according to Mr. Russell. “Kony 2012,” he said, was “the first time we aggressively went after social media.”',\n",
       "   'In his analysis of the video’s spread, Mr. Lotan, the data scientist, noted dense clusters of activity in Dayton, Ohio, and Birmingham, Ala., two cities where Invisible Children had stopped on tour.',\n",
       "   'The spread of the film on the internet opened the organization up to all kinds of critiques. People online debated the film’s racial politics, the ethics of humanitarianism and the utility of “slacktivism,” the equation of likes and shares with action.',\n",
       "   '“The top criticism that I have read about over the years is the oversimplification of a complex issue,” Mr. Russell said. “To that I would say, ‘I hear you, but to make something go viral’ — our goal was to simplify a complex issue — ‘that’s what you have to do.’ In a sense it’s meant as a criticism, but I saw it as a compliment.”',\n",
       "   'At the time, the attention the film received became overwhelming for Mr. Russell, who was filmed walking naked around his neighborhood, yelling obscenities just over a week after its release. “There are very few examples of people who have been publicly shamed and put under that white-hot light that don’t have some kind of breakdown,” he said.',\n",
       "   'The footage was sold to TMZ, according to Mr. Russell, and #Horny2012 overtook #Kony2012 in trending hashtags on Twitter, as inaccurate reports surfaced that he had been masturbating in public. What began as an earnest attempt at consciousness raising had become a meme.',\n",
       "   'But the film clearly struck a chord with viewers, tapping into what Jonah Berger, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the author of “Contagious: Why Things Catch On,” refers to as STEPPS: social currency, triggers, emotion, public practical value and story. These factors appeal to our psychological makeup and basic human motivations, Professor Berger said.',\n",
       "   'Eric Meyerson, the former head of partner marketing at YouTube, said that, at the time, “Kony 2012” leaned on the emotional qualities of the internet’s most resonant videos. Its first three minutes include footage of the Arab Spring and a child riding his bike for the first time.',\n",
       "   '“They were the videos that we at YouTube were trying to promote at the time, to submit for Webbys, the kinds of videos that would inspire good feelings, which are what bring people back to a platform,” Mr. Meyerson said. He added that in some cases viewers were left with the feeling that by consuming and sharing content, “they were helping to change the world.”',\n",
       "   'When Mr. Meyerson joined Facebook in 2015 to lead its video marketing team, that earnest sense of possibility still stood. But after the introduction of Facebook Live in August, the mood shifted, as graphic live-streamed footage started to appear.',\n",

       "   '“The early 2010s was incredibly pivotal in changing our current information environment, and it doesn’t get the attention it deserves,” Mr. Meyerson said.',\n",
       "   'Now, the earliest images of conflict and crisis often come to us through social media, and are informed by the platforms where they are shared. “The advent of digital war has challenged the mainstream media and other elite actors in their capacity to shape what war looks like,” said Andrew Hoskins, an interdisciplinary research professor at the University of Glasgow.',\n",

       "   'A few years ago, Alan Feldman wandered onto the exhibition floor at ICE London, a major event in the gaming industry.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Feldman had spent the past 30 years as an executive with MGM Resorts International, focusing on problem gambling and the financial, personal and professional repercussions. Before his departure from the company, he helped build a nationwide responsible-gambling program that focused on helping players shift their behaviors to reduce the risk of becoming problem gamblers.',\n",
       "   'While on the floor at ICE, he noticed a few companies promoting new products that would use artificial intelligence to not only identify problem gambling, but predict it. Mr. Feldman was immediately skeptical. A.I., he thought, might do a lot of things, but he had never heard of a use that predicted a state of mind.',\n",
       "   'A.I. as a solution to problem gambling “raised far more questions than it did answers,” said Mr. Feldman, now a distinguished fellow in responsible gambling at the International Gaming Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “It was slick, it was interesting, it was compelling intellectually. But whether or not it was really going to do anything, I thought, very much remained at question.”',\n",
       "   'Another question, this one obvious to any observer: Isn’t a problem gambler exactly what a casino wants financially? In short, Mr. Feldman said: no. Even putting aside regulatory issues — gambling operators can be fined or lose their licenses if they fail to monitor problem gambling and act when necessary — it is, counterintuitively, not in their best financial interest.',\n",
       "   '“Casinos need to have customers in order to sustain themselves,” Mr. Feldman said. “And the only way to have customers is to have customers who themselves are healthy and thriving and able to pay their bills and come back the next time.” Problem gamblers “always end the same way,” he added. “The end of the road is the exact same with all of them: They have no money.”',\n",
       "   'Not everyone agrees. Academics who study responsible gambling say those programs are charged with helping people individually without affecting operations on an overall scale.',\n",
       "   '“Some operators have more robust responsible gambling programs than others,” says Lia Nower, director of the Center for Gambling Studies at Rutgers University. “But in the end there is a profit motive and I have yet to see an operator in the U.S. put the same amount of money and effort into developing a system for identifying and assisting at-risk players as they do developing A.I. technologies for marketing or extending credit to encourage players to return.”',\n",
       "   'In either case, the pairing of A.I. and gambling makes perfect sense: unlimited and constant data; decision-making; computerized systems. With the explosion of online gaming, the opportunities to harness this combination for a public good seem endless. The reality — interpreting human behavior, navigating privacy laws, addressing regulatory issues — is much more complicated.',\n",
       "   'At the same time that Mr. Feldman was questioning those potential solutions, Danish researchers were trying to solve the same problems. Mindway AI, a company that grew out of Aarhus University, does exactly what Mr. Feldman was skeptical of: It predicts future problem gambling. Built using research at Aarhus University by its founder, Kim Mouridsen, the company uses psychologists to train A.I. algorithms in identifying behaviors associated with problem gambling.',\n",
       "   'One significant challenge is that there is no sole indicator of whether someone is a problem gambler, said Rasmus Kjærgaard, Mindway’s chief executive. And at most casinos, human detection of problem gambling focuses on just a few factors — mostly money spent and time played. Mindway’s system takes into account 14 different risks. Those include money and time but also canceled bank withdrawals, shifts in the time of day the player is playing and erratic changes of wagers. Each factor is given a score from 1 to 100, and the A.I. then builds out a risk assessment of each player, improving itself with each hand of poker or spin of the roulette wheel. Players are scored from green (you’re doing fine) to blood red (immediately step away from the game).',\n",
       "   'In order to tailor the algorithm to a new casino or online operator, Mindway hands over its data to a group of experts and psychologists trained in identifying such behavior. (The company said they were independent, paid consultants.) They assess each client’s customers and use that model as a sort of baseline. The algorithm then replicates its diagnosis to the full customer database.',\n",
       "   '“As soon as a player profile or player behavior goes from green to yellow and to the other steps as well, we are able to do something about it,” Mr. Kjærgaard said. The value in the program isn’t necessarily just identifying those blood-red problem gamblers; by monitoring the jumps along Mindway’s color spectrum, it predicts and catches players as their play devolves. Currently, he said, casinos and online operators focus their attention on the blood-red gamblers; with Mindway they can identify the players before they ever reach that point.',\n",
       "   'The trickiest step, though, according to Brett Abarbanel, director of research at U.N.L.V.’s International Gaming Institute, is taking that data and explaining it to a player.',\n",
       "   '“If my algorithm flags someone, and it thinks that they’re a problem gambler, I’m not going to send them a note and say, ‘Hey, great news, my algorithm has identified you as potentially a problem gambler. You should stop gambling right away!’” The response would be obvious, Dr. Abarbanel said, deploying a middle finger: “That’s what will happen.”',\n",
       "   'How to actually communicate that information — and what to tell the gambler — is an ongoing debate. Some online-gaming companies use pop-up messaging; others use texts or emails. Mr. Kjærgaard hopes that clients take his data and, depending on the level of risk, reach out to the player directly by phone; the specificity of the data, he said, helps personalize such calls.',\n",
       "   'Since starting in 2018, Mindway has contracted its services to seven Danish operators, two each in Germany and the Netherlands, one global operator and a U.S. sports-gambling operator, Mr. Kjærgaard said. The online gambling giants Flutter Entertainment and Entain have both partnered with Mindway as well, according to the companies’ annual reports.',\n",
       "   'Since this technology is so new and there’s no regulatory body setting a standard, Mindway and similar companies are, for now, essentially on their own. “We wanted to be able to say to you, to anybody else — operators, obviously — that not only do we provide this scientific-based software, but we also want to have a third party to test the validation of what we do,” Mr. Kjærgaard said. “But it is a paradox that there’s no specific requirements which I can ask my team to fulfill.”',\n",
       "   'Currently, Mindway’s technology lives mostly in online gambling. Operators attach Mindway’s GameScanner system to their portal, and it analyzes not only individual risks, but total risks for the system. Applying that level of oversight to in-person gambling is much more difficult.',\n",
       "   'One example of a measure of success can be found in Macau. Casino operators there use hidden cameras and facial-recognition technology to track gamblers’ betting behavior, as well as poker chips enabled with radio-frequency-identification technology and sensors on baccarat tables. This data then heads to a central database where a player’s performance is tracked and monitored for interplayer collusion.',\n",
       "   'This, Mr. Kjærgaard said, is the future: The financial incentives will drive success. “Smart tables” and efforts to address money laundering and financial regulations may eventually provide the data that will supercharge the application of A.I. to in-person gambling.',\n",
       "   '(It also highlights another difficulty in applying A.I. to gambling: cultural differences. In Chinese casinos, Dr. Abarbanel said, the players are used to this level of monitoring; not so in the United States.)',\n",
       "   'A.I. would certainly work for casinos when it came to marketing, promotions and game-suggestion, Mr. Feldman said, but despite progress in recent years, he remains skeptical of its use to help problem gamblers. The application of such a tool may be better used personally instead of broadly, he believes, much like the “Your spending is 25 percent higher than last month” reminders that pop up in online banking accounts.',\n",
       "   '“It’s sort of like drinking. Is there anyone you know who hasn’t gotten drunk once in their life? Doesn’t mean they’re an alcoholic,” he said. “But maybe that one drink a night that’s kind of become one and a half, sometimes two, sometimes three — maybe you want to bring that in a little bit. But you don’t want to have the bar tracking every record here, right?”']},\n",

       "   'Shortly after sunrise on a recent Saturday, an engineer for Inversion Space, a start-up that’s barely a year old, tossed a capsule resembling a flying saucer out the open door of an aircraft flying at 3,000 feet. The capsule, 20 inches in diameter, somersaulted in the air for a few seconds before a parachute deployed and snapped the container upright for a slow descent.',\n",
       "   '“It was slow to open,” said Justin Fiaschetti, Inversion’s 23-year-old chief executive, who anxiously watched the parachute through the viewfinder of a camera with a long lens.',\n",
       "   'The exercise looked like the work of amateur rocketry enthusiasts. But, in fact, it was a test run for something more fantastical. Inversion is building earth-orbiting capsules to deliver goods anywhere in the world from outer space. To make that a reality, Inversion’s capsule will come through the earth’s atmosphere at about 25 times as fast as the speed of sound, making the parachute essential for a soft landing and undisturbed cargo.',\n",
       "   'Inversion is betting that as it becomes cheaper to fly to space, government agencies and companies will want to not only send things to orbit but also bring items back to earth.',\n",
       "   'Inversion aims to develop a four-foot-diameter capsule carrying a payload equivalent to the size of a few carry-on suitcases by 2025. Once in orbit, the capsule could, the company hopes, navigate itself to a private commercial space station or stay in orbit with solar panels until summoned back to earth. Come time to return, the capsule could drop out of orbit and re-enter the atmosphere.',\n",
       "   'The capsule would deploy a parachute to slow its descent and land within a radius of tens of miles from its target location. The company has planned a smaller demonstration capsule with a 20-inch diameter to be ready by 2023.',\n",
       "   'If Inversion is successful, it’s possible to imagine hundreds or thousands of containers floating around space for up to five years — like some (really) distant storage lockers.',\n",
       "   'The company’s founders imagine the capsules could store artificial organs that are delivered to an operating room within a few hours or serve as mobile field hospitals floating in orbit that would be dispatched to remote areas of the planet. And one day, a shortcut through space could allow for unimaginably fast deliveries — like delivering a New York pizza to San Francisco in 45 minutes.',\n",
       "   'Inversion’s founders think what seems like a pipe dream may become more realistic as launch costs drop from current prices, which start at $1 million (and increase depending on weight) to share space on a SpaceX rocket. Inversion declined to offer an estimate of how much its capsules will cost.',\n",
       "   '“The big obstacle that everyone in the sector is trying to overcome is that at current costs, there just isn’t that much demand to do much in space,” said Matthew C. Weinzierl, a professor at Harvard Business School who has published research about the economic potential of space. ',\n",
       "   'For decades, people have imagined living and working in space as an extension of life on Earth. That vision seemed like a Hollywood fantasy until an influx of private rocket companies greatly reduced the costs of getting to space, making commercial activity beyond Earth more feasible.',\n",
       "   'The cost of launching one kilogram, about 2.2 pounds, of payload to outer space has fallen roughly 90 percent in the last 30 years. SpaceX is expected to push costs even lower with Starship, its next-generation rocket still in development. Elon Musk, SpaceX’s chief executive, has said he expects launch costs for the massive rocket to be less than $10 million within three years — compared with the $62 million advertised price for launching the Falcon 9, the company’s widely used rocket.',\n",
       "   'For space to be more accessible than it is today,inexpensively launching rockets is only one part of the equation.',\n",
       "   'Another important factor is facilities in space. Last year, NASA selected three companies to receive funding for commercial space stations as part of a plan to eventually replace the International Space Station. A fourth company, Axiom Space, was awarded a $140 million contract in 2020 to build a habitable module attached to the ISS.',\n",

       "   'Today, the main cargo for rockets is satellites that stay in space. The vehicles carrying humans or experiments from space are large, cost more than $100 million and usually work in tandem with a specific rocket. Inversion said it designed its smaller capsules to fit into any commercial rocket so they can catch a ride to space frequently and inexpensively.',\n",
       "   'What Inversion is trying to do is not easy. Designing a vehicle for re-entry is a different engineering challenge than sending things up to space. When a capsule enters the atmosphere from space, it is traveling at such high speeds that there is the danger of burning up — a huge risk for human travelers and precious nonhuman cargo alike.',\n",
       "   'Seetha Raghavan, a professor in the University of Central Florida’s mechanical and aerospace engineering department, said it would be even more difficult to handle the heat, vibration and deceleration of the capsule when the vehicle size shrank.',\n",

       "   'Inversion’s plan for capsules in orbit raises questions about whether it will contribute to congestion in space, already a problem with the megaconstellations of satellites. And the abundance of satellites interfering with observations of planets, stars and other celestial bodies has been a common complaint among astronomers.',\n",
       "   'But Inversion said it was using materials to make its capsules significantly less reflective to decrease visual pollution. In addition, the company said its capsule would come with systems to avoid debris and collisions in orbit.',\n",

Mr. Fiaschetti declined to identify the customers.',\n",

       "   'Tucked away at the far end of the warehouse — next to a floor-to-ceiling American flag and a basketball hoop — is a black, 10-foot shipping container for testing rocket engines and parachute deployment mechanisms. The structure features steel-reinforced concrete walls, ceiling sprinklers and a system to replace oxygen with nitrogen in the case of a fire.',\n",
       "   'On a recent visit, Inversion was preparing to test a new parachute design. Parachutes are tricky. They have to unfurl perfectly to make sure a capsule will slow down and not rock too much. Many factors, like fabric choice and seam design, can affect a parachute’s effectiveness.',\n",
       "   'While most rocket companies outsource parachute design and production, Inversion sees building their own as an advantage.',\n",
       "   'In an earlier test, Inversion had noticed that the capsule oscillated a lot. On that day, Mr. Fiaschetti, Mr. Briggs, and two engineers had arrived before sunrise on a recent Saturday at an airstrip largely used by sky divers to test a new design.',\n",
       "   'Connor Kelsay, an engineer who oversees Inversion’s parachute design, climbed into the plane with the test capsule, which was affixed with a GoPro camera and an inertial measurement unit to gauge its movements. After he tossed the capsule out of the plane, he waited a few seconds and jumped out after it. An experienced sky diver, Mr. Kelsay circled the capsule, shooting video of its movements from another camera on his helmet.',\n",
       "   'When he landed, he shared the same observation as everyone else: The parachute had been slow to deploy. The team quickly scanned the video and ran down a list of possible factors. Did Mr. Kelsay toss the capsule too roughly? Was there a lot of turbulence when the drop occurred? Was it because they used a differently shaped capsule last time?',\n",
       "   'In the second test, the parachute opened as expected. However, the GoPro camera taped to the capsule fell off in the descent — prompting a frantic search. (They eventually found it.) After the second test, the team thought it had pinpointed the problem: An adhesive fabric tape used to patch a hole had caused the parachute to stick.',\n",
       "   'Afterward, Mr. Fiaschetti said he wasn’t disappointed by the slow parachute opening because it was part of the process.',\n",

       "  'ArticleText': ['The Washington State Senate on Friday passed a bill granting gig drivers certain benefits and protections while preventing them from being classified as employees — a longstanding priority of ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft.',\n",
       "   'While the vote appears to pave the way for ultimate passage after a similar measure passed the state House of Representatives last week, the two bills would still have to be reconciled before being sent to the governor for approval. Gov. Jay Inslee has not said whether he intends to sign the legislation.',\n",
       "   'Mike Faulk, a spokesman for Mr. Inslee, said Friday that the governor’s office usually did not “speculate on bill action,” adding, “Once legislators send it to our office, we’ll evaluate it.”',\n",
       "   'The Senate legislation — the result of a compromise between the companies and at least one prominent local union, the Teamsters — was approved 40 to 8.',\n",
       "   'In a statement, John Scearcy, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 117, said the union was “proud to stand in solidarity with Uber and Lyft drivers in winning their demands for pay raises” and other benefits.',\n",
       "   'Uber and Lyft have noted in regulatory filings that being required to classify drivers as employees would force changes to their business model and could leave them exposed financially. They have sought similar compromises in states including California and New York, but those efforts collapsed amid resistance from other unions and worker advocates, who argued that gig drivers should not have to settle for second-class status. Many of those advocates criticized the Washington bill as well.',\n",
       "   '“While the bill provides some benefits to drivers, it would permanently lock the door on drivers accessing their rights as employees,” said Brian Chen of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group. “That is a misstep with serious ramifications, which is concerning given how fast this bill is moving through the legislature.”',\n",
       "   'Under the compromise, drivers would receive benefits like paid sick leave and a minimum pay rate. The bill would also create a process for drivers to appeal so-called deactivations, which prevent them from finding work through the companies’ apps.',\n",
       "   'While the minimum pay rates apply only to the time that drivers spend with a passenger in the car, supporters of the bill say the rates have been set high enough to compensate drivers fairly for all of their work time after expenses. The rates will be adjusted over time to account for cost of living increases.',\n",
       "   'As with other contractors, drivers must cover all payroll taxes and cannot unionize under federal law.',\n",
       "   'The bill is largely silent on unemployment benefits, something that employees are entitled to, but Washington State has frequently found that gig drivers should receive those benefits already. The bill will create a task force to study what the gig companies’ contributions to an unemployment insurance trust fund should be, an issue that has been contentious in other states.',\n",
       "   'One especially controversial feature of the bill is that it would block local jurisdictions from regulating drivers’ rights. A similar feature helped ignite opposition that killed the prospects for such a bill in New York State last year.',\n",
       "   'Seattle enacted a robust minimum wage law for gig drivers in 2020, which was intended to provide drivers with hourly pay of roughly $30 before expenses and was sharply criticized by gig companies. The statewide bill approved Friday preserved the current rates in Seattle, which will continue to be higher than the rest of the state, but would pre-empt similar legislation in the future.',\n",
       "   'Looming in the background of the legislative action in Washington State was the possibility of a ballot measure that could have locked in contractor status with weaker benefits for drivers. After California passed a law in 2019 that effectively classified gig workers as employees, Uber, Lyft and other gig companies spent roughly $200 million on a ballot measure, Proposition 22, that rolled back those protections. The legislation is still being litigated after a state judge deemed it unconstitutional.',\n",
       "   'Representative Liz Berry, who introduced the Washington State bill, said the differences between it and Proposition 22 “couldn’t be more stark.”',\n",
       "   '“My focus has been: What do the workers want? What are the drivers asking for? And we deliver on every single thing they asked for,” Ms. Berry said in an interview, adding that in contrast to California’s law, “our bill has real benefits that employees in the state of Washington enjoy.”',\n",
       "   'Jen Hensley, Lyft’s head of government relations, said in a statement that the bill was “a solution that Washington State’s drivers overwhelmingly support. Not only does it deliver meaningful new benefits, it also expands important protections for them.” An Uber statement echoed those comments.',\n",
       "   'But some Washington legislators had doubts.',\n",
       "   'Ahead of the vote on Friday, Senator Mike Padden, who opposed the bill, worried about the speed of the approval process. “I do have some concerns about the bill itself, but I also have some concerns about not really being able to check it out properly,” he said.',\n",
       "   'Representative Debra Entenman, the only Democrat to vote against the bill in Washington’s House of Representatives, said in a statement after its Senate passage that “this bill requires too much from the state, delivers too little for drivers, and increases transportation costs for my constituents who often rely on rideshare companies because of inadequate public transportation options.”',\n",
       "   'Worker advocates worried that other states would try to replicate the legislation. “I hope Governor Inslee seeks additional analysis of its potential impact,” said Terri Gerstein, a workers rights lawyer at Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program. “I would urge other states not to use this bill or cursory public process as a model.”']},\n",

And they swarmed into chat rooms, awaiting new instructions and egging each other on.',\n",
       "   'The war in Ukraine has provoked an onslaught of cyberattacks by apparent volunteers unlike any that security researchers have seen in previous conflicts, creating widespread disruption, confusion and chaos that researchers fear could provoke more serious attacks by nation-state hackers, escalate the war on the ground or harm civilians.',\n",
       "   '“It is crazy, it is bonkers, it is unprecedented,” said Matt Olney, the director of threat intelligence at the security firm Cisco Talos. “This is not going to be solely a conflict among nations. There are going to be participants that are not under the strict control of any government.”',\n",
       "   'The online battles have blurred the lines between state-backed hackers and patriotic amateurs, making it difficult for governments to understand who is attacking them and how to retaliate. But both Ukraine and Russia appear to have embraced tech-savvy volunteers, creating channels on the chat app Telegram to direct them to target specific websites.',\n",
       "   'Hackers have inserted themselves in international conflicts before in places like Syria. But experts said that those efforts have attracted fewer participants. The hundreds of hackers now racing to support their respective governments represent a drastic and unpredictable expansion of cyberwarfare.',\n",
       "   'The involvement of the volunteer hackers makes it more difficult to determine who is responsible for an online attack. Some of the hackers said they were Ukrainians living inside and outside the country. Some said they were citizens of other countries who were simply interested in the conflict. It was impossible in some circumstances to verify their identities.',\n",
       "   'Their attacks stand apart from the sophisticated incursions made by nation-state hackers in recent years. While hackers affiliated with the Russian government have quietly infiltrated American government agencies and Fortune 500 companies, these participants have loudly proclaimed their allegiances and used simpler methods to topple or deface websites.',\n",
       "   'And while their tactics appear to have been successful in some instances, security researchers cautioned it was unrealistic to believe cyberattacks by volunteer hackers without specialized technical expertise would play a determinative role in the military campaign on the ground.',\n",
       "   '“The land invasion is advancing, people are suffering, buildings are being destroyed,” said Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and a former cyberwarfare adviser for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. “Cyberattacks can’t realistically impact this.”',\n",
       "   'Ukraine has been more deliberate about recruiting a volunteer hacking force. In Telegram channels, participants cheer their collaboration with the government in going after targets such as Sberbank, the Russian state-owned bank. From Russia, where links between the government and hacking groups have long raised alarms among Western officials, there has not been the same kind of overt calls to action.',\n",
       "   '“We are creating an I.T. army,” Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, tweeted on Saturday, directing cybersecurity enthusiasts to a Telegram channel that contained instructions for knocking Russian websites offline. “There will be tasks for everyone.” By Friday, the Telegram channel had more than 285,000 subscribers.',\n",
       "   'Inside the main English-language Telegram page for the I.T. Army of Ukraine is a 14-page introductory document providing details about how people can participate, including what software to download to mask their whereabouts and identity. Every day, new targets are listed, including websites, telecommunications firms, banks and A.T.M. processors.',\n",
       "   'Yegor Aushev, the co-founder of the Ukrainian cybersecurity company Cyber Unit Technologies, said he was flooded with notes after posting on social media a call for programmers to get involved. His company offered a $100,000 reward for those who identify flaws in the code of Russian cyber targets.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Aushev said there were more than 1,000 people involved in his effort, working in close collaboration with the government. People were only allowed to join if somebody vouched for them. Organized into small groups, they were aiming to hit high-impact targets like infrastructure and logistics systems important to the Russian military.',\n",

       "   'Figuring out who is behind a cyberattack is always difficult. Groups falsely take credit or boast of a bigger impact than actually occurred. But this week there was a string of attacks against Russian targets. The country’s largest stock exchange, a state-controlled bank and the Russian Foreign Ministry were taken offline for a time after being targeted by Ukraine’s volunteer hackers.',\n",
       "   'On Monday, TripAdvisor and Google Maps halted reviews at some locations in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus after pro-Ukraine volunteers targeted the sites to share uncensored information with the Russian public about the war.',\n",

       "   'Yet the involvement of nongovernment groups could escalate quickly and cause unintended consequences, experts warned. A malware attack against one target could quickly spill over and become uncontrollable, as it did during a 2017 attack on Ukrainian government and business computer systems. Or a government might mistake an amateur attack for a state-backed one and decide to retaliate.',\n",

It’s exactly the case in the hard times. Something difficult happens and pretty much the first thing that anyone who knows you says is: “How can I help?” So that is all still happening, and overlaid on that are all these massive sort of impacts that have been affecting our societies from Covid and social justice and some of these climate effects that you’re seeing, whether they be floods or hurricanes or fires and so on.

       "   'The moves, both fallout from Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, stand to further isolate the Russian space agency from its Western space partners, and limit Russia’s private space activities dramatically. OneWeb’s loss of a reliable rocket provider for launches also poses novel challenges for the company as it had aimed to complete its constellation of 648 satellites in orbit later this year.',\n",
       "   'OneWeb was rescued from bankruptcy in 2020 by the British government and other investors. It was scheduled to launch 36 satellites aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan on Friday. The company has sent roughly 400 satellites to orbit since 2019, every time using Soyuz, a workhorse rocket that’s been active since the days of the Cold War space race.',\n",
       "   'But on Wednesday, just after the Soyuz rolled out to the pad ahead of its launch, Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s space chief, announced two conditions aimed at countering the sanctions placed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine: The space agency would not proceed with the satellite mission unless Britain withdrew its multibillion dollar stake in OneWeb and the company provided a “guarantee that its satellites will not be used for military purposes.”',\n",
       "   'Mr. Rogozin also posted a video on Twitter showing Roscosmos personnel on a platform next to the rocket covering up British, American and Japanese flags emblazoned on the rocket’s exterior. “The launchers at Baikonur decided that without the flags of some countries, our rocket would look more beautiful,” said Mr. Rogozin, a former deputy prime minister who often makes bombastic remarks on social media.',\n",
       "   'The space agency’s ultimatum, which came just three days before the previously planned launch, spurred emergency discussions among British officials and OneWeb shareholders, who decided Wednesday night to cease all future launches from Baikonur, the spaceport in Kazakhstan where Russia conducts most of its launches.

Without rockets to launch on, OneWeb’s aim to complete its mega-constellation faces serious disruption. It is competing with SpaceX’s Starlink constellation to beam broadband internet to remote regions around the world.',\n",
       "   'OneWeb had already faced pressure from British politicians to follow energy companies in severing Russian business ties.

       "   'Over the past two decades, government regulators have written and rewritten rules that have landed on a straightforward goal: that Americans who live in apartment buildings may pick their internet provider, even if the landlord has a preferred provider. In many cases, that provider pays for the privilege.',\n",

With the trickle of electric vehicles hitting American roads poised to become a steadier flow this year, his company is betting on the business that will help charge those vehicles. It is offering a nationwide soup-to-nuts service that provides siting, planning, permitting and construction of E.V. charging stations.',\n",
       "   '“Tesla’s been dominant, but now everybody else is getting into the fray,” said Mr. LaNeve, who is 62 and based in Detroit. “And there’s a lot of excitement around the new Hummer, Mustang Mach-E, Ford Lightning, the Silverado and Rivians. People are starting to pay attention to the chargers, too. But no one pays any attention to this: You’ve got to install this stuff. You’ve got to engineer it, and we think it’s a huge business if done right and done at scale.”',\n",
       "   'Mr. LaNeve made his bones in an industry powered by fossil fuels. A onetime C-suite sales and marketing star at Cadillac and Ford and, for three years, Volvo’s North American chief executive, he joined Charge last year. The company, based in New York, has expanded its initial focus — building out wireless communications infrastructure — with its E.V. push.',\n",
       "   '“I basically ran sales and marketing at General Motors and Ford — Big Three, Fortune 100 companies — and enjoyed it immensely,” Mr. LaNeve, now Charge’s president, said during a recent interview. “Got to do things I never dreamed of, frankly. But about four years ago, we had a Tesla in the fleet at Ford. As a kind of a traditional war horse in the auto industry, I didn’t want to like it. I’m like, ‘What’s going on here?’ And I had it for about three days and, I’ve got to tell you, I freaking loved it. And I told everybody there, ‘Guys, this is the future.’”',\n",
       "   'Rick Wagoner, the former G.M. chairman who is on the board of ChargePoint Holdings, which operates charging stations nationally, introduced Mr. LaNeve to Andrew Fox, one of Charge’s founders and its chief executive. Mr. LaNeve sensed an opportunity.',\n",
       "   'The $7.5 billion allocated for charging stations in the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by Congress last year, he said, only increased his optimism.',\n",
       "   'With carmakers and state and federal government entities increasingly looking to combat carbon emissions with electric vehicles, one of the major sticking points to their widespread adoption remains the nation’s undersized and spotty charging infrastructure. That concern was reflected in the infrastructure bill’s call for 500,000 additional E.V. chargers.',\n",
       "   'According to the Energy Department, there are roughly 50,000 (overnight or workday) Level 2 charger locations in service in the United States and Canada, and about 7,000 Level 3 fast charger locations, of which 1,400 are part of Tesla’s supercharging network. (Level 1 charging for the current and future generations of E.V.s is painfully slow.)',\n",
       "   'Mr. Fox, who founded the company in 2003 with Craig Denson and Kenneth Orr, compared the current moment in E.V. charging to one that faced cellphone makers 35-plus years ago. “Just as cellphone utilization was starting out — when utilization was relatively low and they were still a novelty item — over the next 30 years we believe that the infrastructure for E.V. charging is going to mimic the range coverage that you have now with the cellphone industry,” he said.',\n",
       "   'Samuel Abuelsamid, principal analyst with Guidehouse Insights, an advisory firm specializing in infrastructure, concurs with that assessment. “There’s certainly a big, addressable market for this type of service,” he said. “This whole area is something that’s going to be critically important, as you’ve got all these automakers making huge plans to build and hopefully sell millions of E.V.s in the next five to 10 years.”',\n",
       "   'While many current E.V. owners tend to be affluent and can arrange to do most of their charging off street and overnight in their own garages with slower Level 2 chargers, Mr. Abuelsamid noted, “the vast majority of Americans don’t ever buy a new vehicle in their lifetime — about three and a half times as many used vehicles are sold every year as new.”',\n",
       "   '“As you grow the E.V. market, more of them move into the used vehicle market,” he continued. “A lot of these customers are not going to be able to charge at home. They will need public charging infrastructure. So you need to build that out. And companies like Charge are going to be important — helping to figure out where can you locate chargers, especially for DC fast charging, where you need quite a bit of electrical capacity going into the location.”',\n",
       "   'Securing regulatory approvals and reliable local contractors is also necessary, he said.',\n",
       "   'Deciding to piggyback charging onto Charge’s cellular communications business was a crucial move, said Mr. Fox, 49.',\n",
       "   '“E.V. charging is a separate infrastructure, but we didn’t want to vaporize a ton of investor dollars to build this business,” he said. “And so we’ve acquired companies that were providing infrastructure services for telecommunication, because it turns out maybe it’s not the exact same worker, but it’s the same type of work, running cables.”',\n",
       "   'Reporting revenue of $357 million in the first three quarters of 2021, Charge now trades over the counter (as CRGE) but is uplisting to Nasdaq. In January, Charge also added EV Group Holdings, which focuses on real estate assets for commercial fleet operators needing charging depots, to its portfolio.',\n",
       "   'Like Mr. LaNeve, who grew up as the son and grandson of steelworkers in Beaver Falls, Pa., Mr. Fox, raised in Queens, credits blue-collar roots — his father was a union electrician — for his approach to business.',\n",
       "   '“We want to service and pull the whole country into E.V.,” he said. “And so we’ve got this unglamorous work to do.”',\n",
       "   'Mr. Fox and Mr. LaNeve anticipate that eight million to 10 million chargers will be installed across the country over the next 15 or so years. They foresee a constantly changing parade of new technologies and a broad array of places where charging stations might be located, including hotels, supermarkets, health clubs and office buildings.',\n",
       "   '“There’s going to be a lot of interesting partners and models” that emerge, Mr. LaNeve said. “But if you think about a gas station,” he said, “it’s got 10 pumps. When do they make a move that two of those become fast chargers?”',\n",
       "   'The executives readily concede that many of today’s charging stations are inadequate, with inconvenient siting, broken equipment and frequent outages.',\n",
       "   '“As a Tesla owner myself, I can tell you that there’s a lot of friction” at non-Tesla charging stations, Mr. Fox said. “It’s like if you were trying to use a cellphone to go cross-country 30 years ago. You got expensive charges for roaming, you got dropped calls.”',\n",
       "   'The company acknowledges E.V. critics’ oft-repeated concern that the U.S. energy grid will struggle to power a nation of electrified vehicles, but it is confident that solutions will emerge.',\n",
       "   '“Renewables will help, but I think that the other big part of this is, is just the sheer volume of wasted energy in our current system,” Mr. Fox said. “If we could solve for that problem, we’ll have plenty of power in the grid. This is a political point, but it’s not like we’re going to turn it all on tomorrow; it will happen gradually over the next 25, 30 years.” Advances in battery storage technology are particularly important, he said.',\n",
       "   'Again harking back to their humble beginnings, they have further ambitions.',\n",
       "   '“The premise around what we’re doing,” Mr. Fox said, “is creating high-quality jobs. You can’t outsource the work that we’re doing to a foreign country. It has to be done locally. And so we can make our stakeholders’ lives better. We’re creating really great jobs domestically for people who may want to have a trade and may not want to go to college. And I love creating those jobs where someone doesn’t have to work three of those jobs to feed their family.”',\n",
       "   'He said he wanted his company to provide the “gold standard” in the charging industry. “If it has to be done right with professionals, then there’s only going to be a certain type of a caliber of customer that’s going to want that. And so there’s always going to be work for other guys at the bottom.”',\n",

In dialogues, for example, tracking which questions and which follow-ups led to resolving a customer’s problem, she said, and what were the telltale signals of “conversations that went bad.”',\n",
       "   'Early chatbots were programmed with a predetermined set of questions and answers. But that led to dead ends if the software did not understand the questions. Today, Dr. Soffer said, much of the recent innovation lies in “teaching the system to understand and tease out a person’s intent.”',\n",
       "   'Creating software that can determine the essence of a person’s inquiry is a central challenge. “You assume there are only so many ways a person can say something, but you learn that is not really true,” said Bob Beatty, chief experience officer for G.M. Financial.',\n",
       "   'Initially, the financial services arm of General Motors had a rudimentary chatbot that simply delivered canned answers to a set list of questions. But it began working with IBM in 2019 to develop an interactive chatbot. G.M. Financial had a two-year plan to develop and roll out its chatbot, powered by Watson Assistant.',\n",
       "   'The coronavirus pandemic lockdowns in March 2020 meant a surprise acceleration of that timetable. Mr. Beatty sent home the 700 or so agents who worked at the company’s call centers in Arlington, Texas and Chandler, Ariz. While rushing to equip the call center agents for remote work, G.M. Financial, with emails and a notice on its website, steered customers toward its nascent chatbot rather than the phone.',\n",
       "   'The chatbot struggled at first. But the G.M. Financial developers and IBM engineers programmed in the ability to answer more and more inquiries — no matter how they were phrased — like, “What is my payoff amount?” or “Did you receive my March payment?”',\n",
       "   'Even simple questions require personalized answers that the software has to look up in a company database, though. At the start, the chatbot called Nanci (its name is within the word “financial”) was resolving less than 10 percent of customer inquiries. But within two months, the success rate rose to 50 percent — and is now at 60 percent, according to G.M. Financial.',\n",

In January, Mr. Beatty estimated, the company saved a total of $935,000.',\n",

The Biden administration previously avoided imposing certain financial sanctions on the Russian oil and natural gas industries in order to maintain the global energy supply and avoid fueling inflation. But the administration said the measure would take effect over time, gradually degrading Russia’s status as an energy supplier without harming American consumers.',\n",

       "   'Terms of the deal were not disclosed. In a statement, Epic said that Bandcamp “will play an important role in Epic’s vision to build out a creator marketplace ecosystem for content, technology, games, art, music and more.”',\n",
       "   'While a small player compared to giants like Spotify, Apple or YouTube, Bandcamp has become a favorite outlet among musicians for letting them control how their music is shared and sold and giving artists the bulk of the income they receive from those transactions. According to Bandcamp, artists collect an average of 82 percent of every sale, and the company says that since it went online in 2008, its payments to artists and labels are “closing in on $1 billion.” By comparison, last year Spotify said it had paid out $5 billion to music rights holders in 2020 alone.',\n",
       "   'For listeners, Bandcamp has also become a cherished smorgasbord, filled with obscure but wonderful music they may find nowhere else.',\n",
       "   'But as streaming has become the dominant format for music, artists have begun complaining, loudly, that they are not receiving their fair share of the bounty. According to industry estimates, Spotify pays record labels, music publishers and other rights holders about one-third of a cent for every click of a song; what portion of that money makes its way into a musician’s pocket is determined by their deals with those labels and publishers.',\n",
       "   'On Bandcamp, on the other hand, artists can upload their own work and set the pricing rules for downloads of their own work — pay-what-you-wish pricing is common. During the pandemic, Bandcamp has waived its fees once a month on “Bandcamp Fridays,” bringing the company waves of goodwill. Even more surprising, Bandcamp says it has been profitable since 2012. (Last year, Spotify had $10.7 billion in revenue and lost about $276 million, according to company reports.)',\n",
       "   'Epic Games, which is based in Cary, N.C., and is privately owned, said little about its plans for music, and a company spokeswoman declined to answer further questions about the deal. But Epic’s statement on Wednesday indicated that it was interested in Bandcamp as a direct-to-consumer marketplace. “Epic and Bandcamp share a mission of building the most artist-friendly platform that enables creators to keep the majority of their hard-earned money,” the company wrote.',\n",
       "   'Fortnite, Epic’s flagship game, has been one of the most innovative outlets for music in video games, allowing artists to appear virtually, often in elaborately produced segments. In April 2020, the rapper Travis Scott made what was widely seen as a breakthrough appearance, drawing 28 million players to his virtual performance. For Halloween that year, the Latin pop star J Balvin gave a campy concert dressed as a green-haired Frankenstein’s monster, backed by dancers in costume as ghosts and zombie Cyclopes.',\n",
       "   'Epic has also taken center stage in one of the most high-profile debates in current tech policy. The company sued Apple in 2020, saying that the terms of its App Store — which takes payment commissions of up to 30 percent — were unfair. Epic also fought the public-relations battle around that lawsuit with slick, meme-ready content like “Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite,” a parody of Apple’s famous “1984” TV ad that introduced its Mac computer as a joyful disrupter of gray tech monopolies.',\n",
       "   'Last year, in a split decision, a federal judge ordered Apple to give app developers a way for their customers to pay for services that could bypass Apple’s system. Both Apple and Epic Games have appealed that decision.',\n",

       "   '“Bandcamp will keep operating as a stand-alone marketplace and music community, and I will continue to lead our team,” Diamond wrote, telling artists that “you’ll still have the same control over how you offer your music, Bandcamp Fridays will continue as planned, and the Daily will keep highlighting the diverse, amazing music on the site.” The deal with Epic Games, he said, would help Bandcamp expand internationally and “push development forward across Bandcamp.”',\n",
       "   'As news of the deal spread, some independent artists sounded a note of cautious optimism. Tom Gray of the British band Gomez, who has been a leading critic of Spotify and of the streaming economy in general, tweeted a request for Epic Games: “Please think seriously and long,” he wrote, “about whatever you do with the one place independent artists can always rely on for direct income from recorded music.”']},\n",

The company, now called Meta, acknowledged that it didn’t do enough to prevent its site from being abused to incite violence.

The threat center, north of Seattle, had been on high alert, and it quickly picked apart the malware, named it “FoxBlade” and notified Ukraine’s top cyberdefense authority. Within three hours, Microsoft’s virus detection systems had been updated to block the code, which erases — “wipes” — data on computers in a network.',\n",

But in the 1980s and ’90s, after Ethernet was codified into an industry standard, it became the dominant protocol for building networks in corporate offices.

Customs and Border Protection agency (C.B.P.) on their return home in the form of biometric facial recognition. Following a directive by Congress’s 9/11 Commission to increase border security by using biometrics, C.B.P. began ramping up the technology in 2018 in a program called Simplified Arrival. Among other biometric measurements available, including iris scans and fingerprints, the agency selected facial recognition, which uses a computer algorithm to compare a picture taken in person at airport immigration or another border checkpoint to the traveler’s passport picture or visa.',\n",

Addressing equity, Senators Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, and Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, sent a letter to the agency in January requesting more information “to ensure that flagged individuals are treated in a safe, fair and noninvasive manner given the imperfection of facial recognition software.”',\n",
       "   'The following are excerpts from an interview on the issues with Ms. Sabatino, edited for length and clarity.',\n",
       "   'When we looked at different biometric technology — fingerprints, iris and facial scans — we landed with facial because it is such a simple process. Travelers present themselves and their documentation and pose for a quick photo in seconds. The officer has the data they need based on a discussion with the traveler about the purpose of the trip and ultimately can make a decision about whether further examination is needed. We can now leverage technology that’s better at making comparisons. The officer is still the ultimate decision maker. Travelers can opt out.',\n",
       "   'It’s a streamlined process. One benefit is helping officers be more efficient at determining the intent of travel. It’s also better at identifying potential impostors. And the third piece we hadn’t contemplated was the added health benefits. We have a security enhancement at a time and place where individuals are already expected to present themselves for identity verification, and now we’re adding touchless travel and limiting the spread of pathogens. It wasn’t something we were contemplating when we developed it, but it certainly made sense.',\n",
       "   'Manual verification lasts 10 to 30 seconds, depending on environmental factors. Someone outside at a land border could be more challenged because of the lighting. As we automate and refine facial recognition technology, we’re taking two to three seconds to verify the match. The match is one tool in the entire process. That tool doesn’t make the decision to admit or require further examination. It is the officer and the totality of the circumstances. The priority is security.',\n",
       "   'Since deployment, in about the first three years, primarily in the air passenger environment and somewhat in maritime, we have identified about 300 impostors using the technology. That doesn’t mean we would not have otherwise identified them. In the last year, at pedestrian land crossings at the southern land border, it caught about 1,000 to 1,100.',\n",

We are not grabbing images and scraping social media. Individuals are presenting a passport and we have a repository to tap into and build galleries in advance of their arrival using U.S. passport photos and photos of those who have applied for visas. So we build these galleries in the airport and maritime environments based on information already provided for identity verification. We match it to the information we have.',\n",

The design is based on the privacy measures we knew had to be in place. Images for U.S. citizens are retained less than 12 hours and often times much less.',\n",
       "   'That’s certainly something we’re very tuned into. We have partnered with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to provide information on the program. Our high-performing algorithms show virtually no demonstrable difference when it comes to demographics.',\n",

The statement said the countries’ friendship “has no bounds.”',\n",
       "   'The two nations have been growing their ties for years, and the strength of the bond appeared to give Mr. Putin the confidence to move troops and military equipment from Russia’s border with China and other parts of Siberia earlier this winter to Russia’s border with Ukraine and Belarus. The more robust relationship is also ushering in closer economic cooperation.',\n",
       "   '“The joint statement is strong and has lasting consequences for the new world order,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a research professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University.',\n",
       "   'The Chinese and Russian governments share many values, particularly their antipathy to sanctions the West imposes on human-rights grounds. “The two sides firmly believe that defending democracy and human rights should not be used as a tool to exert pressure on other countries,” their pact on Feb. 4 said.',\n",

       "   'But it is not clear if China will help Russia evade sanctions put in place this week. On Tuesday, the Biden administration added to previous measures by announcing sanctions against Russia’s two largest financial institutions and sweeping restrictions on advanced technologies that can be exported to Russia. The technological curbs, when taken in concert with allies, would block roughly a fifth of Russian imports, the administration said.',\n",
       "   'Chinese companies that circumvent those rules could face escalating punishment by the United States, including criminal and civil penalties, said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Those businesses could also be cut off from American technology and the financial system.',\n",
       "   'ZTE and Huawei, two Chinese firms that were barred from receiving American technological exports, attracted the attention of the U.S. government in part for evading sanctions on Iran.',\n",
       "   '“The interesting question is: Is China going to comply with this?” Mr. Chorzempa said. China also has a law designed to penalize companies for following extraterritorial sanctions by countries like the United States, he said, all factors that “could put companies in a real bind.”',\n",
       "   '“If they don’t comply with the U.S., they’re in trouble with the U.S., but if they don’t comply with China, they could also face penalties in China,” he said.',\n",
       "   'Of course, collecting fines from companies that are unwilling to pay and monitoring whether businesses comply with the rules could be difficult, Mr. Chorzempa added. “It’s already proving difficult to monitor the things that are already controlled, and if you expand that list, that’s going to be a real challenge to verify what’s going to Russia,” he said.',\n",

If they continue supplying to Russia, SMIC and other Chinese companies could be cut off from U.S. technology, the same kind of penalty that crippled Huawei. On Friday, Taiwan Semiconductor said it was committed to complying with the export controls.',\n",
       "   '“If Beijing is viewed as Moscow’s enabler, pressure will rise in the U.S. Congress to extend these restrictions,” Mr. Wildau wrote in a note to clients. Beijing would also face the risk that other major technology exporters, like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands, “would adopt Washington’s tougher line,” he said.',\n",
       "   'China’s state-owned banks could also face risks for continuing to lend to Russia. China and Russia have been settling more of their trade using the renminbi and the ruble. Beijing has also been trying to develop the digital use of its currency as an alternative to the dollar, which could help Russia limit the effect of financial sanctions.',\n",
       "   'But Chinese banks are still deeply reliant on the U.S. dollar. While major Chinese banks already appeared to be pulling back their financing for Russia, Mr. Wildau said, Beijing could choose to support Russia using smaller state-owned banks that don’t do a lot of international business that requires the use of the dollar.',\n",
       "   'China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela and other countries have all felt the brunt of American financial sanctions, highlighting their need for more trade and investment in currencies other than the dollar, Mr. Mok said.',\n",
       "   'Even if Chinese entities circumvent U.S. rules, Beijing is unlikely to publicize it. Despite its professed distaste for sanctions, China regularly punishes trading partners that have offended it in some way. But it does this through unannounced orders sent to customs officials, to avoid clear violations of international trade rules.',\n",

Shortages of everyday items like toilet paper and disinfectant spray were a painful reminder of the fragility of supply chains — an issue that consumers are still grappling with as they face delays for everything from furniture to cars. It has contributed to price volatility, exacerbated by inflation at its highest levels in four decades — driving up the costs of energy, food and housing.',\n",

       "   'Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said this week that it would display Reels on more places in its apps. Reels are also taking prime real estate at the top of the screen when people open the Facebook app. Maybe soon we’ll see Reels of used cars that are listed on Facebook’s version of Craigslist.',\n",
       "   'Shoving Reels into our eye holes is a little bit sad, a little bit brilliant — and worth watching as a test of Facebook’s ability to will itself into continued popularity. Leveraging success to make further success is how dominant companies win — and it has worked for Facebook before — but it’s also how dominant companies lose.',\n",
       "   'Facebook might be the most interesting technology story to watch in 2022. The company could be on the cusp of the last days of an empire or about to reinvent itself again and become even more popular and richer.',\n",
       "   'We might not want to admit it, but the fate of Facebook and its strategies affect us all. This company’s choices about which features to prioritize influence how billions of people interact, the ways that businesses reach their customers and the look and feel of the rest of the internet.',\n",
       "   'Reels is an essential part of Facebook’s strategy to head off the company’s worst fears about losing its appeal to young people and shriveling into irrelevance. Facebook wants some of that TikTok coolness, and it made its own version of that app for Instagram.',\n",
       "   'It’s not clear if Reels is a particularly effective copycat of TikTok, but it might not matter.',\n",
       "   'Facebook has said that Reels is catching on and that people using its apps are increasing the time they spend with the videos more than almost anything else. The company expanded Reels from Instagram to the Facebook app and now into more spots in those apps and in more countries. The company is also experimenting with financial incentives to compel more professional internet entertainers to make Reels.',\n",
       "   'We can’t really know for sure how popular Reels are or why. Are people latching on to Reels because they like them, or because they’re just there? Google said recently that videos from its own version of TikTok, YouTube Shorts, are viewed 15 billion times each day. The number is so big that I didn’t believe it at first, but I should have. Google has billions of users, and that is a valuable asset to grab attention for new things.',\n",
       "   'Maybe Facebook’s versions of TikTok, Zoom or Nextdoor aren’t great, but the company has many ways to nudge the billions of people using its apps to try them. The company can see what people seem to like and don’t, tinker and keep making a new product better — and unavoidable — until it takes hold.',\n",
       "   'That’s pretty much what Facebook did about five years ago with Stories, its copycat of the most popular feature on Snapchat. Facebook experimented with the video-and-photo chronicles of people’s days on Instagram and made them prominent in the company’s apps, and then they won.',\n",
       "   'The playbook for Reels seems almost identical, and Facebook executives have essentially said to investors: Hey, we made Stories catch on and we’ll do it with Reels, too. Putting its muscle behind new products isn’t foolproof for Facebook. This isn’t even the company’s first try at copying TikTok.',\n",
       "   'Following other tech companies’ leads doesn’t make Facebook seem inventive, although it might not matter. The history of Silicon Valley is marked by companies that didn’t necessarily make a product first or best but made it biggest.',\n",

The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. New York and Minnesota also joined the lawsuit.',\n",

President Biden signed an executive order last year to spur competition in different industries. He also appointed Lina Khan, a prominent critic of the tech giants, to lead the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter, a lawyer who has represented large companies, as chief of antitrust efforts at the Justice Department.',\n",

UnitedHealth is one of the largest health corporations in the country, with $287.6 billion in revenue in 2021. In addition to its health care information technology business, its Optum unit owns physician practices, a large chain of surgery centers and one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit managers.',\n",
       "   'At the center of the Justice Department’s lawsuit is the data that Change Healthcare gathers when it helps process insurance claims. The department argued that the deal would enable UnitedHealth to see the rules that its competitors used to process claims and undercut them. UnitedHealth could also crunch data about patients at other insurers to gain a competitive advantage, the agency said.',\n",

It says that UnitedHealth’s former chief executive saw the tech company’s data as the “foundation” of the reasoning behind the deal.',\n",

The Justice Department added that the deal would give UnitedHealth a monopoly over a type of service that was used to screen insurance claims for errors and speed up processing.',\n",

A congressional committee has investigated whether Amazon uses data from outside merchants who use its platform to develop competing products, for example.

       "   'That is true. And also, well … no? Or maybe?',\n",
       "   'Fresh data from the U.S. government shows something that surprised me: Physical stores beat online shopping in 2021. No joke.',\n",
       "   'Americans spent 18 percent more on food, cars, furniture, electronics and other retail products last year compared with 2020, the Commerce Department disclosed on Friday. Online retail sales increased by 14 percent. In other words, e-commerce lost ground last year to brick-and-mortar stores.',\n",
       "   'Admittedly, 2021 was a strange year for shopping. More of us had the urge to browse in person than we did in the scary first months of Covid in the U.S. Climbing prices and shortages changed what people bought and where they shopped. And one year doesn’t alter the long-term trend that online shopping is grabbing more of Americans’ wallets.',\n",

One of the big debates for our economies and lives is how much the coronavirus and the digital adaptations to it might permanently alter all aspects of how we spend our time, including the future of office work, moviegoing and exercise habits. The honest answer is that we don’t really know. Much has changed, but a lot has not.',\n",
       "   'Brian Wieser is one of my favorite numbers nerds, and he alerted me to the fact that physical stores won in 2021. Wieser, the global president of business intelligence for the advertising firm GroupM, said that he’d taken to zooming out in two-year blocks of time to assess the disruptive effects of the pandemic on businesses and us.',\n",

       "   'It’s a confusing time to assess what technology has changed in us. Wieser’s visual metaphor of a plateau is useful. Maybe we’ve reached a new level of familiarity with and use of technologies. That doesn’t mean we can predict where we go from this new perch.',\n",

       "   'The endorsements underscore how right-wing Americans and conspiracy theorists are shifting their online activity in response to greater moderation from tech giants like Google. They have increasingly embraced fledgling and sometimes fringe platforms like the chat app Telegram, the video streamer Rumble and even search engines like DuckDuckGo, seeking conditions that seem more favorable to their conspiracy theories and falsehoods.',\n",

They must now try to deliver relevant results for obscure search terms and avoid surfacing possible misinformation, all while steering clear of censorship claims.',\n",
       "   'DuckDuckGo, which has about 3 percent of the United States search market, holds little direct control over the links in its search results because they are generated by the search engine algorithm provided by Bing, which Microsoft owns. And all search engine algorithms are considered black boxes because the companies that create them do not completely disclose what informs their decisions.',\n",

For instance, searching for “Satanist Democrats,” a theory that Democrats worship Satan or perform satanic rituals, surfaced several links advancing the conspiracy theory.

Yahoo fared worse than Bing and DuckDuckGo, and the Russian search engine Yandex fared worst among the group.',\n",

That criticism increased during the 2016 presidential election, when the spread of misleading and false news stories caused growing alarm among misinformation watchdogs. Around the same time, Google users noticed that a search for “did the Holocaust happen” surfaced a white supremacist website as its top result. Google tweaked its algorithm in response, now weighing a website’s reliability to a greater extent, alongside the content’s relevance to the search term.',\n",

       "  'ArticleText': ['TEMPE, Ariz. — Early in the pandemic, when shops along Mill Avenue in downtown Tempe closed their doors and students at nearby Arizona State University were asked to go home, the roar of construction continued to fill the air. Now, gleaming in the sunlight and stuffed with amenities, towering glass office buildings have sprouted up all over the Phoenix metropolitan area.',\n",
       "   'Arizonans are about to have new next-door neighbors. And they include some of the technology industry’s biggest names.',\n",
       "   'DoorDash, the food delivery company, moved into a new building on the edge of a Tempe reservoir in the summer of 2020. Robinhood, the financial trading platform, rented out a floor in an office nearby. On a February morning, construction workers were putting the finishing touches on a 17-story Tempe office building expected to add 550 Amazon workers to the 5,000 already in the area.',\n",
       "   'The frenetic activity in the Phoenix suburbs is one of the most visible signs of a nationwide recovery in commercial office real estate fueled by the tech industry, which has enjoyed unchecked growth and soaring profits as the pandemic has forced more people to shop, work and socialize online.',\n",
       "   'Big tech companies like Meta and Google were among the first to allow some employees to work from home permanently, but they have simultaneously been spending billions of dollars expanding their office spaces. Doubling down on offices may seem counterintuitive to the many tech workers who continue to work remotely. In January, 48 percent of people in computer and math fields and 35 percent of those in architecture or engineering said they had worked from home at some point because of the pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.',\n",
       "   'But companies, real estate analysts and workplace experts said several factors were propelling the trend, including a hiring boom, a race to attract and retain top talent and a sense that offices will play a key role in the future of work. In the last three quarters of 2021, the tech industry leased 76 percent more office space than it did a year earlier, according to the real estate company CBRE.',\n",
       "   '“I think there are a lot more companies that are saying, ‘You’re coming back to work’ — it’s not ‘if,’ it’s ‘when,’” said Victor Coleman, the chief executive of Hudson Pacific Properties, a real estate investment group. “The reality is that most companies are currently working from home but are wanting and planning to come back to the office.”',\n",
       "   'Debates over whether workers should be required to return to the office can be thorny because some employees say they have been happier and more productive at home. One way companies are trying to lure them back is by splurging on prime office space with great amenities.',\n",
       "   'Big Tech executives say that office expansions are to be expected and that modernized buildings will probably be spaces for people to collaborate rather than stare at screens. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, leased 730,000 square feet in Midtown Manhattan in August 2020, and has added space in Silicon Valley as well as in Austin, Texas; Boston; Chicago; and Bellevue, Wash.',\n",
       "   '“We will continue to grow and expect many people to return to our offices around the world once it’s safe,” said Tracy Clayton, a Meta spokesman.',\n",
       "   'Google said early last year that it would spend $7 billion on new and expanded offices and data centers around the country in 2021, including $2.1 billion to buy a Manhattan office building by the Hudson River, and growth in Atlanta; Silicon Valley; Boulder, Colo.; Durham, N.C.; and Pittsburgh. Google also said in January that it would spend $1 billion on a London office building.',\n",
       "   'Offices “remain an important part of supporting our hybrid approach to work in the future,” Google said in a statement.',\n",
       "   'During the pandemic, Microsoft has expanded in Houston; Miami; Atlanta; New York; Arlington, Va.; and Hillsboro, Ore. The company was growing to accommodate the many new employees it has hired over the last two years, said Jared Spataro, the vice president of modern work for Microsoft.',\n",
       "   '“The pandemic, I think, has just changed people’s perception of what’s possible in terms of geographic distribution,” Mr. Spataro said.',\n",
       "   'In April, Apple said it would build a campus near Raleigh, N.C., and has added space in San Diego and Silicon Valley. The company, which has battled with its employees over its plan for a majority of workers to return to offices most days each week, referred to its April news release about expansion but declined to comment further.',\n",
       "   'Salesforce, whose signature tower looms over the San Francisco skyline, is moving forward with four new office towers planned before the pandemic, in Tokyo, Dublin, Chicago and Sydney, Australia. The company said last February that many employees could be fully remote, but shifted its messaging months later, saying that “something is missing” without office life and urging workers to come back in.',\n",
       "   'Salesforce’s thinking about the office has evolved, said Steve Brashear, the company’s senior vice president in charge of real estate. At the start of the pandemic, the feeling was that “being remote sounds so great and so safe,” Mr. Brashear said. Now, “the idea of being isolated as a remote worker has its drawbacks.”',\n",
       "   'The industry’s search for land has been so extensive that it has surged through longtime tech hubs like Silicon Valley and into areas not traditionally known for their tech scenes.',\n",
       "   'In Phoenix, for instance, tech leasing activity grew more than 300 percent from mid-2020 to mid-2021. New leases, subleases and renewals in the area totaled more than one million square feet from April through September last year, up from about 260,000 square feet a year earlier, according to CBRE.',\n",
       "   'Other locations not normally associated with tech also saw growth. In Vancouver, British Columbia, tech leasing activity doubled in growth in mid-2021, to 561,000 square feet from 268,000, as did activity in Charlotte, N.C., to 143,000 square feet from 71,000.',\n",
       "   'Amazon has been one of the most prolific in expansion, announcing in 2020 that it would increase its white-collar work force in half a dozen cities. In Phoenix, its logo is ubiquitous, and it will occupy five floors in the new Tempe office building expected to be finished this year.',\n",
       "   'Holly Sullivan, Amazon’s vice president of economic development, said adding to its regional hubs allowed the company “to tap into wider and more diverse talent pools, provide increased flexibility for current and future employees, and create more jobs and economic opportunity across the country.”',\n",
       "   'For developers, the focus on offices is good for business, and some interpret the growth as an indictment of the fully remote model.',\n",
       "   'The thinking on remote work is “like a pendulum — it swung a little bit too far, and now it’s come back a little bit,” said George Forristall, the Phoenix real estate director at Mortenson Development.',\n",
       "   'The flurry of expansions also highlights how much better tech has fared than other industries during the pandemic. In some cities, remote work and high vacancy rates continue to hurt restaurants and retailers.',\n",
       "   'Office vacancy rates in San Francisco climbed to 22.4 percent at the end of 2021 from 21.5 percent in the third quarter of the year, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate firm. The city’s economists called tourism and office vacancies “special areas of concern in the city’s economic outlook.” In New York, office vacancy rates declined to 14.6 percent, according to JLL, but areas dependent on office workers to power local businesses, like Midtown Manhattan, are recovering more slowly.',\n",
       "   'Smaller tech companies, given their financial constraints, might have to choose whether to invest in physical spaces or embrace a more flexible strategy. Twitter has continued to add offices in Silicon Valley, and video game developers like Electronic Arts and Epic Games have expanded in places like Canada and North Carolina. But others have cut back.',\n",
       "   'Zynga, a gaming company, offered up its 185,000-square-foot San Francisco headquarters for sublease last summer because it decided that shrinking its physical office and moving would make life easier for employees, said Ken Stuart, vice president of real estate at Zynga. Its new building in San Mateo, Calif., will be less than half the size.',\n",
       "   '“The reality is that people are frustrated by the commute and getting into the city, and also people feel like they can do better work by being hybrid,” Mr. Stuart said.',\n",
       "   'By contrast, the largest tech giants “have so much money that it doesn’t matter,” said Anne Helen Petersen, a co-author of “Out of Office,” a recent book about the remote-work era. Because of their huge budgets, Ms. Petersen suggested, such companies can continue constructing offices without worrying about how much money they stand to lose if the buildings become obsolete.',\n",
       "   '“They’re hedging their bets,” Ms. Petersen said. “If the future’s going to be fully distributed, ‘we’ll be setting up an apparatus for that.’ If the future’s going to rubber-band back to everyone back to the office, the way it was in 2020, ‘we’ll go back to that.’”',\n",
       "   'In Tempe, the two-floor WeWork co-working space at the Watermark, one of the premier office spaces, was buzzing with activity on a recent afternoon. Upstairs, Amazon has rented an entire floor.',\n",
       "   'Below, amid leafy plants and colorful lighting, employees at tech start-ups clacked away on MacBooks and sketched on whiteboards. Many said it had become more crowded in recent months, and more companies were renting the small office spaces within the WeWork.',\n",
       "   'Sam Jones, a co-founder of a nonfungible token start-up, Honey Haus, said his company had been renting a four-person space within WeWork for $1,850 a month since October.',\n",
       "   '“I am just way less productive at home,” Mr. Jones said. “People are definitely, I think, realizing that physical space just has something special to it.”']},\n",

He called her his “little sweetheart,” and told her that he was planning to take her to China to meet his family when the pandemic was over.',\n",

       "   \"Within weeks, Ms. Vu, 33, had sent more than $300,000 worth of Bitcoin, nearly her entire life savings, to an address that Mr. Zhao had told her was connected to an account on the Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange OSL. The website looked legitimate, offered 24/7 online customer support and had even been updated to show Ms. Vu's balance changing as the price of Bitcoin rose and fell.\",\n",

       "   '“I thought I knew him,” she said. “Everything was a lie.”',\n",
       "   'Romance scams — the term for online scams that involve feigning romantic interest to gain a victim’s trust — have increased in the pandemic. So have crypto prices. That has made crypto a useful entry point for criminals looking to part victims from their savings.',\n",
       "   'About 56,000 romance scams, totaling $139 million in losses, were reported to the Federal Trade Commission last year, according to agency data. That is nearly twice as many reports as the agency received the previous year. In a bulletin last fall, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Oregon office warned that crypto dating scams were emerging as a major category of cybercrime, with more than 1,800 reported cases in the first seven months of the year.',\n",
       "   'Experts believe this particular type of scam originated in China before spreading to the United States and Europe. Its Chinese name translates roughly as “pig butchering” — a reference to the way victims are “fattened up” with flattery and romance before being scammed.',\n",
       "   'Jan Santiago, the deputy director of the Global Anti-Scam Organization, a nonprofit that represents victims of online cryptocurrency scams, said that unlike typical romance scams — which generally target older, less tech-savvy adults — these scammers appear to be going after younger and more educated women on dating apps like Tinder, Bumble and Hinge.',\n",

       "   'Jane Lee, a researcher at the online fraud-prevention firm Sift, began looking into crypto dating scams last year. She signed up for several popular dating apps and quickly matched with men who tried to offer her investing advice.',\n",

       "   'Ms. Lee, whose company works with several dating apps to prevent fraud, said that these scammers typically tried to move the conversation off a dating app and onto WhatsApp — where messages are encrypted and harder for companies or law enforcement agencies to track.',\n",
       "   'From there, the scammer bombards the victim with flirtatious messages until turning the conversation to cryptocurrency. The scammer, posing as a successful crypto trader, offers to show the victim how to invest his or her money for fast, low-risk gains.',\n",
       "   'Then, Ms. Lee said, the scammer helps the victim buy cryptocurrency on a legitimate site, like Coinbase or Crypto.com, and provides instructions for transferring it to a fake cryptocurrency exchange. The victim’s money appears on the exchange’s website, and he or she starts “investing” it in various crypto assets, under the scammer’s guidance, before the scammer ultimately absconds with the money.',\n",
       "   'What makes this particular scam so insidious is how much more elaborate it is than the Nigerian prince scams of yore. Some victims have described being directed to realistic-looking websites with charts and tickers showing the prices of various crypto assets. The names and addresses of the fake exchanges are changed frequently, and victims are often allowed to withdraw small amounts of money early on, making them more comfortable depositing larger sums later.',\n",
       "   '“This kind of scam is quite labor-intensive and time-consuming,” Mr. Santiago, of the Global Anti-Scam Organization, said. “They’re very meticulous in their social engineering.”',\n",
       "   'Cryptocurrencies are particularly useful to scammers, experts say, because of the relative privacy they offer. Bitcoin transactions are publicly visible, but because digital wallets can be set up anonymously, technically sophisticated criminals can obscure the trail of money. And because there is no central bank or deposit insurance to make victims whole, stolen money usually can’t be recovered.',\n",

       "  'ArticleText': ['You’re going to feel silly, Angela Trimbur promised.',\n",
       "   'It was a Sunday, and Trimbur, a dancer and choreographer in a Jane Fonda-worthy ’80s leotard, was leading a class in a midtown Manhattan studio. Nearly 50 people were lured in by her pitch: an afternoon twirled away in unserious but very intentional movement. The goal, Trimbur said, was to attain the effervescence of children putting on a backyard dance show.',\n",
       "   '“We’re equal, we’re 13, and we’re just going to do some silly choreography to show our parents before dinner,” she said. “That’s the vibe.”',\n",
       "   'To loosen inhibitions, Trimbur suggested some screaming. And hugging a stranger. Dancers — clad in everything from ballet slippers with ripped tights to Converse and kneepads — were instructed to run across the room, wail in one another’s faces, then embrace. I joined in: It felt great and powerful and properly ridiculous. The energy was equal parts eighth-grade gym class and righteous affirmation.',\n",
       "   'Then came the routine, to a synthy 1986 cover of “You Keep Me Hangin’ On.” “I don’t do counts,” Trimbur said, directing us to slap our bottoms, roll on the ground, switch-kick, punch and spin. Her references were less Balanchine and more “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective” — she choreographs for faces, too. “F.Y.I. flailing about wildly IS dancing,” she wrote in her newsletter.',\n",
       "   'The kind of intuitive movement Trimbur champions, low-stakes and accessible, found a new audience during the pandemic, as dancers and dance teachers migrated online. Ryan Heffington — the pop choreographer whose Los Angeles studio, the Sweat Spot, helped a “come one, come all” dance culture blossom there — had tens of thousands of followers (Trimbur among them) in his Instagram Live sessions during early lockdown. Even eminences like Debbie Allen two-stepped for the feed, finding an unexpected communion, though everyone was literally dancing on their own.',\n",
       "   'Among this blossoming crop of teachers and influencers, and the legions of creators making their moves into memes on TikTok, Trimbur, 40, stands out. Underpinned by an intimate, self-revealing aesthetic, she fluidly navigates from sweaty group class to phone screen to ambitious project — dance is her public palliative for physical and emotional upheaval. And yet, she makes it fun.',\n",
       "   \"“With her, it’s really the endorphins, the feeling that you’re in love, kind of, that she can generate,” said the filmmaker Miranda July, a friend and collaborator. Evan Rachel Wood, another friend and creative partner, trusts her implicitly: “I would privately make my own dance videos and edit them and play around,” she said, “but I would never show anybody — except Angela, because that's the energy that Angela brings. It’s about authenticity.”\",\n",
       "   'A short, lavish-looking dance film, “Unauthorized,” that Trimbur choreographed and Wood directed, yet to be released, is set to songs from Fiona Apple’s 2020 album “Fetch the Bolt Cutters.” In solos and with other artists, some traditional dance stars and some not, Trimbur leads in scenes across the Los Angeles cityscape and its dusty barrens. It starts off moving with sweet musical precision and turns into something more wild, womanly and beautiful, needling into male-female power dynamics and rebirth. Wood and Trimbur made it as a way to cope with the pandemic and other struggles, they said.',\n",
       "   'Trimbur’s work is full of empathy for people who, like her, are striving, July said. “All they have is their own bodies, which don’t work perfectly and might be failing them in a million different ways, and still they’re alive, and she’s alive, and that’s what the dance is about — that’s all right there with her.”',\n",
       "   'That she unspools all her ups and downs on Instagram has endeared her to almost 100,000 followers. In the pandemic-born social-media dance boom, even established artists found new footing. Though Heffington is commercially successful and spent a decade growing Sweat Spot (it closed during the pandemic), he said the overwhelming, global response to SweatFest, his Instagram series, changed his life. It redefined for him what was possible in ridding dance of its intimidation factor, pivoting it away from perfection and helping his followers find the joy. (It also raised substantial money for charity.)',\n",
       "   '“It’s not about how high you kick, your flexibility — none of these traditional rules or metrics matter, in this new wave of thinking and including people,” Heffington, who planned to quietly start teaching in person again this month, said in a phone interview. “It’s just because you want to do it; that’s enough. Let’s lower the bar — let’s bury that bar — and allow everyone to come and just participate.”',\n",
       "   'In Los Angeles, where she lived until late last year, Trimbur had built a reputation as a community dance maven, hosting “Slightly Guided Dance Parties” at the Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art, and conjuring viral dance videos even pre-TikTok. (She’s also an actress, most recently playing a roller-skating influencer on “Search Party,” the HBO Max dark comedy.) She created and for six years led a women’s dance squad that performed at local basketball games and inspired fierce devotion among its fans and members.',\n",
       "   'That crew and other friends enveloped her when, in 2018, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy, and then six reconstruction and related surgeries. She documented her treatment online, becoming an advocate for other cancer patients, and setting up a support network through the video-messaging app Marco Polo (about 500 people joined, she said).',\n",
       "   'During the pandemic, the dance squad dissolved. And after a “Search Party” shoot last summer made Trimbur fall in love with Brooklyn — “I’ve never felt this alive, you know? New York is magical” — she packed up 15 years of her West Coast life and her two pet cockatiels, and moved. Now she is reigniting her career here, from a Bushwick loft that she is decorating in high gloss black-and-white to resemble an ’80s nightclub. There are multiple disco balls, 1981 Vogue magazines fanned out atop a panther coffee table, and a boxy white TV/VCR that had been in her childhood bedroom. When I met her at home for an interview, she popped in a VHS of “Dirty Dancing.”',\n",
       "   'She choreographs in the studio-style mirrors she had installed, and teaches a Zoom dance-fitness class — lately called “apathetic aerobics,” for when you can’t manage the regular high-pitched workout zeal. (It’s set to emo.)',\n",
       "   'Trimbur is also developing a TV show about her life for a cable network, she said, with July as a producer. They met when July cast her as a YouTube dancer in her 2011 film “The Future”; later, they discovered a mutual affinity for estate sales, and started surreptitiously recording improvised scenes there.',\n",
       "   '“She’s a really special combination of innocent and blunt,” July said. “Sometimes she’ll say something and I’ll just want to write it down, because it’s perfectly put, but not the therapy version of it, which is sort of rare these days.”',\n",
       "   'Trimbur grew up outside Philadelphia, where her mother ran a dance studio — “When she picked up the phone, it would be like, ‘Pitter Patter Dance Studio, where everyone’s a star!’” Trimbur and her sister, Colleen, were its exemplary pupils, learning all the routines. But when Trimbur was around 12, her mother became a Jehovah’s Witness, closed the studio and pulled her children out of school. Trimbur’s formal dance education largely ended then, but she spent hours at home, filming herself dancing — just as she does now.',\n",
       "   '“The way that I like to think about dance is the version of myself that’s, like, stuck inside in my living room, just dancing to Mariah Carey,” she said. “That’s what brings me joy, to just be free and not think about what’s the right step.” Still, New York’s multifaceted dance scene brings new possibilities, and Trimbur is already envisioning taking Broadway-style classes and staging adult recitals at school auditoriums. (A Valentine’s Day couples dance event she organized for the Bell House in Brooklyn quickly sold out.)',\n",
       "   'Dancing through and after cancer has been its own revelation. Hosting the “Slightly Guided Dance Parties” during chemo, she sometimes had to step offstage to regain her energy, she said, but she didn’t regret the gig. Dancing, she said, “is the way that I talk to myself.” She and Wood made the Fiona Apple short just before she got her breast implants removed; as a dancer, Trimbur said, “they just felt like stapled Tupperware.” As part of treatment, she also had her ovaries removed, so the film is an emotional memento, one of her last instances of performing with her old body.',\n",
       "   '“It was palpable watching Angela dance — I fully understood that that is how she processes things,” Wood said.',\n",
       "   'Trimbur begins her in-person classes with students in a fetal position for a womb-like meditation, followed by a close listen of, say, Christina Aguilera’s “Beautiful.” It’s not uncommon for people to cry, she said.',\n",
       "   'She wants to unlock them from those emotions when they begin to wiggle up: “Get weirder, girls, get weirder!” she extolled, in the class I attended.',\n",
       "   'In another class, she instructed, “there’s a part in the song where you’re going to throw yourself on the floor like a toddler” having a tantrum — “but the face is cute.”',\n",
       "   '“I want to be able to just make people laugh through dance without it being too, like, honk, honk,” she told me, mimicking a schlocky comedian with an airhorn. There was a sense of gleeful abandon in that Manhattan studio — I’ve rarely seen so many students smiling in between reps — as the shrieks mixed with giggles.',\n",
       "   'Her New York dancers are already hooked. “It’s like church,” said Chelsy Mitchell, 32, a dance newbie who has been coming weekly since Trimbur started her Sunday classes, traveling an hour-and-a-half one way from her home upstate. “Dance therapy.”',\n",
       "   'Catherine McCafferty, a 20-something comedian and actor, had the weight of 18 years of ballet and other dance training when she stepped into Trimbur’s studio for the first time that afternoon. She’d come because she liked what she saw on Instagram, but she was also new to New York and nervous that she wouldn’t measure up. Instead of feeling judged, she felt released. “The only eyes that are on you are a bunch of other people who want you to shine,” she said.',\n",
       "   'For Trimbur, that atmosphere of validation is paramount. “I get so frustrated when somebody says something like, ‘I can’t dance,’ or they say, ‘I’m the worst one’ or ‘no one wants to see me do that,’” she said. “It’s so sad because I know, scientifically, how happy you could be, if you gave yourself permission to move.”']},\n",

       "   'Spotify was already the king of music streaming. But to help propel the company into its next phase as an all-purpose audio juggernaut, and further challenge Apple and Google, it wanted a superstar podcaster, much as Howard Stern helped put satellite radio on the map in 2006. Spotify executives came to view Joe Rogan — a comedian and sports commentator whose no-holds-barred podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” was already a monster hit on YouTube — as that transformative star.',\n",
       "   'In May 2020, after an intense courtship, Spotify announced a licensing agreement to host Mr. Rogan’s show exclusively. Although reported then to be worth more than $100 million, the true value of the deal that was negotiated at the time, which covered three and a half years, was at least $200 million, with the possibility of more, according to two people familiar with the details of the transaction who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss it.',\n",
       "   'But in recent weeks the show that helped Spotify catapult into a market leader for podcasts has also placed it at the center of the sort of cultural storm that has long engulfed Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, over questions about the responsibility tech behemoths have for the content on their platforms.',\n",
       "   'It began when several prominent artists, led by Neil Young, took their music off the service to protest what they described as Covid vaccine misinformation on Mr. Rogan’s show. Then clips from old “Joe Rogan Experience” episodes caught fire on social media, showing him using a racial slur repeatedly and chuckling at jokes about sexual exploitation, prompting Mr. Rogan to apologize for his past use of the slur. A #DeleteSpotify social media campaign began calling for a boycott. And some Spotify podcasters publicly criticized Mr. Rogan and the platform.',\n",
       "   'Spotify declined to make company executives available for interviews. Dustee Jenkins, a spokeswoman for the company, declined to comment on the terms of Mr. Rogan’s deal. Representatives of Mr. Rogan did not respond to multiple requests for comment.',\n",
       "   'Even in the frothy podcast market, the deal for “The Joe Rogan Experience” was extraordinary. Spotify had purchased entire content companies, Gimlet Media and The Ringer, for slightly less than $200 million each, according to company filings.',\n",
       "   'With tens of millions of listeners for its buzziest episodes, “The Joe Rogan Experience” is Spotify’s biggest podcast not only in the United States but in 92 other markets, with a following that hangs on every word of his hourslong shows. In its financial reports, Spotify cites podcasts — and Mr. Rogan’s show in particular — as a factor in the long-sought growth of its advertising business. At a recent company meeting, Daniel Ek, Spotify’s chief executive, told employees that exclusive content like Mr. Rogan’s show is vital ammunition in Spotify’s competition against tech Goliaths like Apple and Google.',\n",
       "   'As Mr. Rogan faced growing public criticism, Spotify responded by reaffirming its commitment to free speech, even as dozens of Mr. Rogan’s past episodes have been removed. It also made its content guidelines public for the first time, said that it would add “content advisory” notices to episodes discussing the coronavirus and promised to contribute $100 million for work by creators “from historically marginalized groups.”',\n",
       "   'The moves came as Spotify faced growing dissension among high-profile creators. This month Ava DuVernay, the film director who announced a podcast deal with Spotify a year ago but has yet to produce any content under it, severed her ties with Spotify, according to a statement from her production company, Array. And Jemele Hill, the former ESPN commentator, said that Spotify’s defense of Mr. Rogan had created problems with her audience, and raised questions about the sincerity of the company’s dedication to minority talent.',\n",
       "   '“What I would like to see,” Ms. Hill said in an interview, “is for them to hand $100 million to somebody who is Black.”',\n",
       "   'For Spotify, the move into podcasting is the culmination of years of strategy to find a business that is more profitable than hosting music, for which it must pay about two-thirds of every dollar to rights holders.',\n",
       "   'The company dipped its toe into video around 2015, but little came of it. By 2018, the year Spotify listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, it was forming plans to pursue Mr. Rogan, hoping to supercharge its market position in non-music audio and to chip away at the dominance of Apple and Google’s YouTube.',\n",
       "   'To make Spotify a player in podcasting, Mr. Ek and his deputies, including Dawn Ostroff, a former television and magazine publishing executive, and Courtney Holt, formerly of Maker Studios, an online video network, set out on a multipart strategy. Spotify would buy audio studios, like Gimlet, and acquire exclusive rights to existing shows. With Spotify Originals, the company would also create buzzy new programs in partnership with creators like Ms. DuVernay’s Array and Higher Ground, the production company of former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama.',\n",

       "   'The strategy had seemed to be working for Netflix, which produced its first original show in 2012 as a way to differentiate itself from other streaming services. Barry McCarthy, a former top executive at Netflix, was Spotify’s chief financial officer until early 2020 and is now on its board. (Earlier this month, he was named the chief executive of Peloton.) Ted Sarandos, the co-chief executive officer of Netflix, is also on the board.',\n",
       "   'With podcasts, Spotify could be more in charge of its own destiny, and could pocket more of the advertising and subscription fees it relies on. And with the company’s later acquisitions of start-ups like Megaphone and Whooshkaa, Spotify could provide better tools for both the many podcasters who work with Spotify and the marketers who purchase ads on the platform. This week, Spotify expanded its portfolio of podcast tools by acquiring two more companies, Podsights and Chartable. ',\n",
       "   'Ultimately, the goal was to provide a pathway for different kinds of content to make its way onto the platform, as the company made clear when it announced that “audio — not just music — would be the future of Spotify.”',\n",
       "   'There was one podcast that executives felt could accelerate Spotify’s growth at the pace the company wanted: “The Joe Rogan Experience.”',\n",
       "   'Since the show’s debut in 2009, Mr. Rogan, a mixed martial arts enthusiast and comedian, had made himself into a podcasting heavyweight, landing an eclectic range of guests and engaging them in freewheeling, uncensored conversations.',\n",
       "   'The results could be wildly entertaining, as when Mr. Rogan smoked marijuana with Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of Tesla, in 2018. Or they could be inflammatory, as when Mr. Rogan hosted the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones — who has spread bogus theories that the 2012 killing of 20 children and six educators at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., was a hoax — despite Mr. Jones being barred from Spotify for violating its prohibition on hate speech two years prior.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Rogan is no standard, one-sided media talking head. He supported Bernie Sanders for president and stumps for universal health care. But he also has some libertarian views and expressed skepticism about vaccines, suggesting that “healthy” young people, for example, do not need to get vaccinated for Covid-19, contrary to what scientists and health officials were urging. The left-leaning watchdog group Media Matters for America has documented more than 20 instances of what it characterizes as Covid-19 misinformation, bigotry and anti-trans language on Mr. Rogan’s show — in 2021 alone.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Rogan’s show was one of the biggest success stories in podcasting, but for years it was not available on Spotify. In May 2020, Spotify wooed him with an offer he couldn’t refuse.',\n",
       "   'After the deal was made official, Mr. Rogan had a message on his show for fans who might fear more corporate control: “It will be the exact same show. I am not going to be an employee of Spotify.”',\n",
       "   'Spotify’s stock price jumped 17 percent the week the deal was announced.',\n",
       "   'For many rank-and-file employees at Spotify, landing Mr. Rogan was far from something to be celebrated. He was already known for elevating controversial figures like Mr. Jones and Gavin McInnes, founder of the alt-right group the Proud Boys. The news that Mr. Rogan would be joining the platform brought with it an initial wave of concern inside the company, according to several current and former employees.',\n",
       "   'That reached a flash point in September 2020, when a number of employees pushed back against episodes of Mr. Rogan’s show that they felt were transphobic. One employee group, Spectrum — made up of L.G.B.T. members or supporters — pressed management over why Spotify had made the deal with Mr. Rogan despite knowing how divisive some of his content could be, according to current and former employees who witnessed the events at the time.',\n",
       "   'There had also been concerns within Spotify that the company had not invested enough in moderation tools to review podcasts, an area known as “trust and safety.” The deluge of podcasts each week introduced new risks about harmful content that the company had not previously dealt with as a music service.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Ek defended the company’s decisions at the time, while meeting with many of the concerned employee groups to try to assuage their concerns. Management’s position, however, was clear: Mr. Rogan wasn’t going anywhere.',\n",
       "   'As the months wore on and Mr. Rogan showed no sign of shying away from controversy, more people connected to the company began to speak out against his presence on the platform.',\n",
       "   'In January, after 270 scientists, medical professionals and others wrote to Spotify to raise alarms about Covid-related misinformation on Mr. Rogan’s show, executives made assurances internally that the company was taking the issue seriously and that it was continuing to review Mr. Rogan’s shows to make sure they were complying with Spotify’s rules, said a person involved in the discussions.',\n",
       "   'The issue exploded on Jan. 24, when Mr. Young, the rock icon, posted a public letter demanding that his music be removed from Spotify over coronavirus misinformation. “They can have Rogan or Young,” he wrote. “Not both.”',\n",
       "   'Joni Mitchell followed him off the platform, and within days, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who have their own deal to produce podcasts for Spotify but have produced only one, voiced their own concerns about Covid misinformation on the platform.',\n",
       "   'Amid the backlash, Mr. Rogan promised to add “balance” to the conversations on his show. But days later, the crisis widened when the R&B singer India.Arie posted a video compilation of Mr. Rogan repeatedly using a racial slur, and said she wished to withdraw her music as well. She and other musicians also used the episode to reiterate long-running complaints that the streaming economy does not pay artists enough.',\n",
       "   'As the controversy swirled, many Spotify workers felt management was too slow to respond, two current employees said. It also raised alarms on Spotify’s board of directors, where some members have been disappointed by the company’s halting response, according to a person familiar with the events who asked to remain anonymous because of confidentiality agreements.',\n",
       "   'Management of the crisis in the United States may have been further complicated because Spotify’s headquarters is nearly 4,000 miles away, in Sweden, where Mr. Ek, a publicity-shy executive who grew up in a suburb of Stockholm, and many of the company’s engineers and longest-tenured employees are based. ',\n",
       "   'Free expression is a deeply held belief in Sweden. Many employees there — and in the United States — were angry when Spotify removed music by R. Kelly and XXXTentacion from playlists in 2018 for content or conduct deemed offensive, a decision the company quickly reversed.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Ek has made it clear that he is wary of taking on the role of censor. “We’re not in the business of dictating the discourse that these creators want to have on their shows,” he told employees earlier this month in a speech first reported by The Verge, adding that “if we only wanted to make content that we all like and agree with, we will need to eliminate religion, and politics, and comedy, and health, and environment, and education, the list goes on and on and on.”',\n",
       "   'And as a business matter, censoring Mr. Rogan could alienate his legion of fans and set a slippery precedent with other podcasters, according to Mark Mulligan, an industry analyst with Midia Research.',\n",
       "   '“That could put at risk their future podcast strategy,” Mr. Mulligan said.',\n",
       "   'In a recent memo to employees, Mr. Ek wrote that “canceling voices is a slippery slope” but acknowledged that a number of episodes of Mr. Rogan’s show had been removed from the platform. He wrote that Mr. Rogan had decided to remove them after meetings with Spotify executives and “his own reflections.”',\n",

       "   'Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.',\n",
       "   'The investigation is the latest safety concern that Tesla has been confronted with. Separately this year, Tesla recalled 54,000 cars equipped with its Full Self-Driving software to disable a feature that in certain conditions let the vehicles roll slowly through intersections without stopping. Failing to stop at a stop sign can increase the risk of a crash, the safety agency told Tesla in a letter.',\n",
       "   'The agency also opened a formal investigation last year into Autopilot and how it identifies objects and other vehicles on the road. That inquiry was prompted by 11 incidents in which Teslas operating in Autopilot failed to stop for and crashed into police cars, fire trucks and other emergency vehicles that had flashing lights turned on.',\n",
       "   'In the last few months, Tesla recalled 12,000 cars to correct a braking problem and recalled 458,000 others for two separate mechanical defects.

That is a delicious target for companies.',\n",

       "   '“I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!” the minister said. “So, because you are lukewarm — neither hot nor cold — I am about to spit you out of my mouth.”',\n",
       "   'The words jolted Mr. Gelsinger, reshaping his philosophy. He realized he had been a lukewarm believer, one who practiced his faith just once a week. He vowed never to be neither hot nor cold again.',\n",
       "   'Now, at age 60, Mr. Gelsinger is hot about one thing in particular: Revitalizing Intel, a Silicon Valley icon that lost its leading position in chip manufacturing.',\n",
       "   'The 120,000-person company was a household name in the 1990s, celebrated as a fount of innovation as its microprocessors became the electronic brains in the vast majority of computers. But Intel failed to place its chips into smartphones, which became the device of choice for most people. Apple and Google instead grew into the trillion-dollar emblems of Silicon Valley.',\n",
       "   'Rejuvenating Intel is partly about Mr. Gelsinger’s own ambitions. As a young engineer, he once wrote down a goal of leading Intel one day. But in 2009, after spending his entire career at the company, he was forced out. A year ago, he was wooed back for a surprise second chance.',\n",
       "   'His mission is also about America’s place in the world. Mr. Gelsinger wants to return the United States to a leading role in semiconductor production, reducing the country’s dependence on manufacturers in Asia and easing a global chip shortage. Intel, he believes, can spearhead the charge. If he succeeds, the impact could extend far beyond computers to just about every device with an on-off switch.',\n",
       "   'The quest faces many obstacles. Steering a $200 billion company while chasing a goal of raising U.S. chip production to 30 percent globally from about 12 percent today requires tens of billions of dollars, political maneuvering with governments and years of patience.',\n",
       "   '“You’re going to have to spend a lot of money and you’re going to have to spend it for a long period of time,” said Simon Segars, who recently stepped down as chief executive of Arm, a British company whose chip designs power most smartphones. “Whether governments have the stomach for that over the long term remains to be seen.”',\n",
       "   'In four interviews, Mr. Gelsinger acknowledged the difficulties. But the father of four and grandfather of eight has pursued the goals with intensity.',\n",
       "   'In March, he unveiled a $20 billion project to add two chip factories to Intel’s complex near Phoenix. Last month, he joined President Biden to showcase a $20 billion investment in a new chip manufacturing site near Columbus, Ohio. On Tuesday, he announced a $5.4 billion deal to buy Tower Semiconductor, which operates chip production services from factories in four countries.',\n",
       "   'To drum up government support for his investments, Mr. Gelsinger has attended three virtual White House gatherings, spoken with two dozen members of Congress and four governors. He became a key ally to President Biden over a $52 billion package that would provide grants to companies willing to set up new U.S. chip factories. And in Europe, Mr. Gelsinger met with President Emmanuel Macron of France, President Mario Draghi of Italy, their counterparts in other countries, and the pope.',\n",
       "   'It has been a tough slog. Intel’s stock has dropped as Mr. Gelsinger committed huge sums to chip manufacturing. The $52 billion funding package stalled for months in the House of Representatives, finally passing this month as part of broader legislation that must now be reconciled with a Senate version. Criticism of the chief executive from Wall Street analysts has ramped up.',\n",
       "   '“Every day the job is way bigger than me,” Mr. Gelsinger said. But “it’s OK,” he added, because he believes he has help. “God, I need you showing up with me today because this job is way more than I could possibly do myself.”',\n",
       "   'If his father had managed to buy a farm, Mr. Gelsinger would almost certainly have inherited it and become a farmer. That was expected in Robesonia, a borough in Pennsylvania Dutch country where he was raised and worked on his uncles’ farms.',\n",
       "   'But there was no farm to inherit. So at age 16, Mr. Gelsinger passed a scholarship exam that took him to the Lincoln Technical Institute, a for-profit vocational school, where he earned an associate degree.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Gelsinger tells this and other stories self-deprecatingly in a 2003 book of advice that he wrote for Christians titled “Balancing Your Family, Faith & Work,” which was expanded in 2008 and titled, “The Juggling Act: Bringing Balance to Your Faith, Family, and Work.”',\n",
       "   'In 1979, he was interviewed at the technical institute by a manager from Intel. Unlike most of the other students there, Mr. Gelsinger had heard of the company. He breezed through questions related to his studies and predicted he could earn bachelor’s, master’s and Ph.D. degrees while holding down a full-time job, said Ronald Smith, the former Intel executive who conducted the interview.',\n",

       "   'Mr. Gelsinger took his first plane ride to interview at Intel in California, where he started in October 1979 as a technician. He worked on improving the reliability of microprocessors while studying for a bachelor’s degree at Santa Clara University.',\n",
       "   'He soon started hanging out with the engineers who designed the chips, coming up with ideas to test the chips more efficiently. In 1982, he became the fourth engineer on the team that introduced the groundbreaking 80386 microprocessor.',\n",
       "   'During a 1985 presentation near the completion of the chip, Mr. Gelsinger chided Intel’s leaders Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore and Andy Grove about balky company computers that were slowing the process.',\n",
       "   'A few days later, he got a surprise call from Mr. Grove. The Hungarian-born executive, then Intel’s president who later wrote the management book “Only the Paranoid Survive,” had built a culture where lower-level employees were encouraged to challenge superiors if they could back up their positions. Mr. Grove began mentoring Mr. Gelsinger, a relationship that lasted three decades.',\n",
       "   'By 1986, Mr. Grove had convinced Mr. Gelsinger not to pursue a doctorate at Stanford University and instead made him, at age 24, the leader of a 100-person team designing Intel’s 80486 microprocessor. Mr. Gelsinger eventually earned eight patents, became Intel’s youngest vice president in 1992 and the first person with the title of chief technology officer in 2001.',\n",
       "   'His climb up Intel’s ladder was shaped by another priority: his faith.',\n",
       "   'Though raised in the mainstream United Church of Christ, Mr. Gelsinger said he didn’t really become a Christian until he attended the nondenominational church in Silicon Valley where he met Linda Fortune, who later became his wife. It was at that church in 1980 that he heard the minister quote Revelations.',\n",
       "   'After Mr. Gelsinger became a born-again Christian, he wrestled privately with whether to join the clergy. In a 2019 oral history conducted by the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., he said he eventually decided to become a “workplace minister,” where “you really view yourself as working for God as your C.E.O., even though you’re working for Intel.”',\n",
       "   'In the mid-2000s, Mr. Gelsinger’s footing within Intel shifted. Mr. Grove retired as board chairman in 2004. Another executive, Paul Otellini, was appointed chief executive in 2005. Mr. Gelsinger said he was a “dissonant voice” on Intel’s senior executive team.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Otellini pushed him to leave, Mr. Gelsinger said. (Mr. Otellini died in 2017.) In 2009, Mr. Gelsinger accepted an offer to become president and chief operating officer of EMC, a maker of data storage gear.',\n",
       "   'Departing Intel after 30 years as a company man hurt badly. “I was just so angry and emotional about the departure,” Mr. Gelsinger said.',\n",
       "   'In 2012, he became chief executive of VMware, a software company that EMC controlled. He weathered challenges there, including an aborted effort to compete in cloud computing services with Amazon, but broadened the company’s business and nearly tripled revenues.',\n",
       "   'During those years, Intel slipped. For decades, the company had led the industry in delivering regular factory advances that pack more processing power into chips. But delays in perfecting new production processes allowed rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung Electronics to grab the lead in manufacturing technology between 2015 and 2019.',\n",
       "   'Today, T.S.M.C. makes chips designed by hundreds of other companies. It supplies the world with more than 90 percent of the chips made with the most advanced production technology. Because it is headquartered in Taiwan, which China has laid territorial claim to, its location has made it a political and supply chain chokepoint should conflict erupt over the island nation.',\n",
       "   'Intel was also suffering from its missteps in the mobile market, which consumes billions of processors compared with the hundreds of millions sold for computers.',\n",
       "   'After convincing Apple to use its chips in Macintosh computers in 2005, Intel had a chance to win a place in the iPhone, which debuted in 2007. But Mr. Otellini said in a 2013 interview in The Atlantic that he turned down the opportunity because the price that Apple was willing to pay for chips was too low to make a profit.',\n",
       "   'The decision, which Mr. Otellini said he regretted, led Apple to use rival Arm technology for smartphones and, later, tablets. So did Samsung and other companies that make devices using Google’s Android software. More recently, Apple started using Arm chips in many new Macs.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Otellini and his successors prioritized Intel’s profit margins while failing to take risks to move into new markets and outflank rivals, former company insiders now acknowledge. If boiled down to a book, “it could be called ‘the insufficiently paranoid don’t survive,’” said Reed Hundt, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman who served on Intel’s board from 2001 to 2020, in a nod to Mr. Grove’s “Only the Paranoid Survive.”',\n",
       "   'As questions swirled about Intel’s future, Mr. Gelsinger was viewed as a possible savior. But he insisted he was committed to VMware, a point he seemed to underscore by adding a temporary tattoo with the company’s name on his arm during a 2018 conference in Las Vegas.',\n",
       "   'Then, just before Thanksgiving 2020, an Intel director asked Mr. Gelsinger to join the company’s board. Mr. Gelsinger asked for permission from Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, which then controlled VMware.',\n",

Early in their marriage, they had committed to giving an increasing percentage of their gross income to philanthropic causes such as schools in Kenya and Christian nonprofits, with the percentage reaching about 50 percent, he said in the oral history.',\n",
       "   'Their values came up during what he said were “three weeks of chaos” over the Intel job. The couple concluded that Intel’s size and influence would give Mr. Gelsinger a global platform to promote technology for good purposes, not to mention serving as a Christian role model.',\n",
       "   '“The fact that I continue to be very public about my faith is seen more and more like a unicorn in the market,” he said. “I would hope to make it less so.”',\n",

       "   'He drafted a plan to expand Intel’s manufacturing operations. He also wanted to emulate T.S.M.C. by making semiconductors for other companies and not just Intel’s own microprocessors. Becoming a major provider of these “foundry services” could also buffer America from future supply chain shocks.',\n",
       "   'In January 2021, at a virtual meeting with Intel’s board, Mr. Gelsinger insisted the nine directors unanimously endorse him and the manufacturing expansion strategy. They did.

       "   'Apple’s changes to its iOS software on iPhones asked users for permission before allowing advertisers to track them. Apple’s permission controls — and, ultimately, the decision by users to block tracking — have had a profound impact on internet companies that built businesses on so-called targeted advertising.',\n",

       "   'Anthony Chavez, a vice president at Google’s Android division, said in an interview before the announcement that it was too early to gauge the potential impact from Google’s changes, which are meant to limit the sharing of data across apps and with third parties. But he emphasized that the company’s goal was to find a more private option for users while also allowing developers to continue to make advertising revenue.',\n",
       "   'As the world’s two biggest smartphone software providers, Google and Apple hold significant sway over what mobile apps can do on billions of devices. Changes to increase privacy or provide users with greater control over their data — a growing demand from customers, regulators and politicians — come at a cost for companies collecting data to sell ads personalized to a user’s interests and demographics.',\n",
       "   'Mr. Chavez said that if Google and Apple did not offer a privacy-minded alternative, advertisers might turn to more surreptitious options that could lead to fewer protections for users. He also argued that Apple’s “blunt approach” was proving “ineffective,” citing a study that said the changes in iOS had not had a meaningful impact in stopping third-party tracking.',\n",
       "   'An Apple spokesman declined to comment.',\n",
       "   'The changes from Google and Apple are significant because digital advertising based on the accumulation of data about users has underpinned the internet for the last 20 years. But that business model is facing more challenges as users have grown more suspicious about far-reaching data collection amid a general distrust of technology giants.',\n",
       "   'The difference in approaches between Apple and Google also speaks to how each company makes the bulk of its money. Apple generates most of its revenue from selling devices, while Google makes its money largely from selling digital advertising and may be more open to considering the needs of advertisers.',\n",
       "   'Wayne Coburn, a product director at Iterable, a marketing software company, said it was not surprising that Google was taking these steps when Apple was aggressively pitching privacy as a selling point over products running Android. Still, he said Google’s approach felt like a “weak gesture” by providing a two-year timeline. He expects the company will be pressured to “do more, faster.”',\n",
       "   '“This is a reaction to what Apple has done,” Mr. Coburn said. “Google wouldn’t be doing this on their own.”',\n",
       "   'Google said it planned to bring its privacy initiative, Privacy Sandbox, which had been limited mainly to reducing tracking on the company’s Chrome browser, to Android — the world’s most widely used software for mobile devices. Google has been forced to revamp its approach to eliminating so-called cookies, a tracking tool, on Chrome while facing resistance from privacy groups and advertisers.',\n",
       "   'Google said it was proposing some new privacy-minded approaches in Android to allow advertisers to gauge the performance of ad campaigns and show personalized ads based on past behavior or recent interests — as well as new tools to limit covert tracking through apps. Google did not offer much in terms of detail about how these new alternatives would work.',\n",
       "   'As part of the changes, Google said, it plans to phase out Advertising ID, a tracking feature within Android that helps advertisers know whether users clicked on an ad or bought a product as well as keep tabs on their interests and activities. Google said it already allowed users to opt out of personalized ads by removing the tracking identifier.',\n",
       "   'The company said it planned to eliminate identifiers used in advertising on Android for everyone — including Google. Mr. Chavez said Google’s own apps would not have special or privileged access to Android data or features without specifying how that would work. This echoes a pledge Google made to regulators in Britain that it would not give preferential treatment to its own products.',\n",
       "   'The company did not offer a definitive timeline for eliminating Advertising ID, but it committed to keeping the existing system in place for two years. Google said it would offer preview versions of its new proposals to advertisers, before releasing a more complete test version this year.',\n",

       "  'ArticleText': ['On some of her very long days, and most of her workdays of late are very long, Tiffany Dyba, a 39-year-old recruiter in New York, recalls with a little nostalgia a hiring job she once held at a luxury-fashion designer.',\n",
       "   'Back then, people were so eager to get her their résumés that a young woman once looked up Dyba’s photo on LinkedIn and then waited outside her office on Madison Avenue to intercept her on her way into work. On another occasion, Dyba, making conversation with a possible hire, mentioned that she had a fondness for toffee — and the next day, toffee, beautifully wrapped, appeared in her office. Back then, the people she was hiring were hungry, they were eager. There were flowers. Carefully crafted thank-you notes. Those were things a recruiter might not expect but might occasionally enjoy. A recruiter felt wanted.',\n",
       "   'But Dyba eventually struck out to work for herself, and then the world changed. A virus flourished, and office buildings emptied, with their tenants uploading their systems to the ether; the cloud filled and then it filled some more, and with that massive digital shift, Dyba found herself, a person who majored in psychology, who could be intimidated briefly by the “merge calls” function on her iPhone, working in a field so hot that it is sucking more and more people like her into its ever-expanding vortex: technology recruiting.',\n",
       "   'Recruiters working in technology these days do not receive candy, flowers or thank-yous. The recruiter is lucky if she can get someone on the phone — if she receives so much as an email in response. Technology workers need court no one: Along with microchips, toilet paper and Covid tests, tech workers will be recalled as one of the great, pressing shortages of this pandemic. Estimates of the unemployment rates for tech workers are about 1.7 percent, compared with roughly 4 percent in the general economy; for those with expertise in cybersecurity, it’s more like 0.2 percent. Tech employees today tire of the attention from recruiters, the friendly hellos on LinkedIn, the cold calls (which Dyba does not make). “They think we’re like used-car salesmen,” Dyba said of her quarry. To be a recruiter in tech is to be an in-demand commodity for those companies doing the hiring but to feel like something of a nuisance — like an essential gear that emits a loud, irritating noise.',\n",
       "   'In late January, Dyba, working on contract with a tech company on the West Coast, sent out a mass blast on LinkedIn, tailored to reach data analysts, which is to say free of the kind of friendly, conversational fillips she might otherwise include (“Your LinkedIn profile looks amazing” and “I hope this finds you well!”). Data analysts — really, they just want the data. “Hi [name],” Dyba wrote in the message. “We’re looking for a talented Data Analyst to analyze huge data sets, build predictive models, and help us drive growth. I thought you could be a great fit.” The job she posted listed its selling points — the business had 400 percent growth a year, the backing of a legendary venture capitalist, no limit to personal vacation days, full coverage of employee health-care premiums and the option to work remote or locally.',\n",
       "   'Dyba estimates that she sent the listing to about 75 prospective hires and received back maybe five responses, three of which were either a brief “no thanks” or the simple declination of her InMail message. A declination — that’s LinkedIn language for “Please, stop throwing all these jobs at me with employer-paid health-insurance premiums and unlimited vacation time.”',\n",
       "   'Recruiters are in such demand that they, too, are scarce, which means their fees have never been higher. In-house tech-recruiter salaries are up about 30 percent, estimates Daniel Wert, who works at a boutique executive-search firm in the design community. Organizations looking for help in cloud and cybersecurity positions have increased fees they are offering to recruiting services to as high as 45 percent of the first year’s salary, says Ryan Sutton, a district president in charge of technology recruiting for the staffing firm Robert Half. Dyba says she has more work than she has had since she started freelance-recruiting in 2018.',\n",
       "   'Dyba’s challenges — most tech recruiters’ challenges — go beyond simply finding humans. As the people talking to potential hires, recruiters have a big-picture view of just how quickly the market is currently moving, something they need to translate to hiring managers without giving the impression they’re doing a hard sell. Dyba recently wrote to an executive who was hesitating to make an offer on a hire who was slipping away, texting a kind of recruiter haiku:',\n",
       "   'we need to moveif we are gonna movejust thought I would tell you',\n",
       "   'Recruiters are often in the position of breaking the bad news that a desired candidate has flat-out rejected an offer, often to executives used to having the upper hand in the market or to founders convinced their business is more innovative than Apple and with better snacks than Facebook.',\n",
       "   'Jana Rich, founder and chief executive of Rich Talent Group, a firm that primarily recruits executives to companies in the tech and consumer industries, says that even at the highest levels of hiring, she has never seen a market like this in 30 years. It falls on her, sometimes, to have what she calls “the truth talk” with a chief executive or board member: to break the news that qualified candidates have multiple — or sometimes preferable — opportunities. Now, she gently explains, an employer might have to think about taking a leap of faith on someone very talented but slightly less experienced. It doesn’t always go well. Following a recent truth talk, she said, the company put the search on pause, making it clear that “basically, ‘We, the company, don’t necessarily believe you,’” she said. “Like, ‘We think we can do better.’”',\n",
       "   'Pent-up demand after those early pandemic months when no one was hiring is part of the problem, Rich says. And a general feeling of pandemic malaise can help explain the shortage of potential hires — every so often, she reaches out to someone with a top-level job, only to hear, as she put it, “I don’t know if I have the energy in the tank.”',\n",
       "   'Highly skilled tech workers, for the most part, are not leaving the workplace — the money right now is simply too good (salaries have risen in some cities by as much as 10 percent). They are, however, leaving the workspace, in droves, to work remotely, which is another aspect of the new world of work that recruiters need to communicate to founders and chief executives, some of whom are intent on getting the office back to what it once was.',\n",
       "   '“If you are not going to offer remote work, if you’re not going to offer at least hybrid, we can’t help you,” Sutton says he tells clients trying to hire software designers. Tatiana Becker, the founder of NIAH Recruiting, was called in to help another recruiter from a different firm, who had already contacted every local potential candidate to fill a chief-of-staff position at an online retailer that hoped to have its employees in the office full time. After Becker told her colleague that the employer was going to have to drop one of the three requirements to fill the position — ideally, the one that called for regular on-site work in New York — the client wrote her a snippy email making it clear that Becker’s help was no longer wanted: “Unfortunately the recommendation you made to drop one or two of our requirements,” the client wrote, “was frankly completely inappropriate.”',\n",
       "   'When working with one employer in a city that is not known as a tech hub, Dyba felt that she had to chip away, carefully, at the company’s insistence for on-site workers; one position had been open for six months. Dyba started showing the hiring manager the credentials for someone she’d found, but omitted a crucial detail. If the employer was interested, then and only then did she reveal that the talent was based in Florida or Boston. “I had to kind of say, ‘Listen, it’s costing more money right now for us to keep this job open than it would be for you to send someone a laptop and coach your leadership team differently about how to manage remotely,’” she said. She believes the hiring manager raised the issue with the chief executive; slowly, someone with decision-making power came around, and Dyba was able to start filling positions. When the pandemic ebbs and local workers are back in that office, 15 to 20 percent of its work force will be remote. The market rather than Dyba changed the company’s workplace culture — a market of empowered technology workers who could pick and choose their employers, who could take or leave any job they wanted and were forcing a shift.',\n",
       "   'Dyba hit a low back in October, when after working for months to land a signed offer for a qualified candidate for one company, she then lost that hire when the candidate’s current employer swooped in with a generous, last-minute retention bonus. She had a signed offer! That had never happened to her before. Now she counts on nothing: “I don’t stop interviewing until I have a butt in the seat — like I am aggressively still looking for candidates even after we have a signed offer.”',\n",
       "   'Workplaces also keep shifting unpredictably in ways that wreak havoc on the hiring process. A business doesn’t have a vaccine requirement, then it does. Employees are told they can work remotely and then the employer starts floating the idea that everyone will need to come back. Between constantly changing conditions and the number of counteroffers that job candidates receive, Sutton says, around four in five of the deals his recruiters try to seal end up requiring last-minute finessing on some major point; that happened only about 30 percent of the time before the pandemic, he estimates.',\n",
       "   'By late January, Dyba had been trying for several months, with mounting frustration, to find someone for a senior position for a high-growth start-up whose executive team insisted that the position be filled by someone willing to work at least part time on-site in New York. The calculation, when chief executives still make it, has become an interesting leap of faith. It reflects a belief that having a team on the ground, regularly working together, sharing the air and locking eyes across a conference table, will yield greater success than handpicking the most talented, experienced team a recruiter could possibly source from all 50 states and having them forge some new kind of work environment from their respective remote locales.',\n",
       "   'All day long, Dyba sent out feelers, and all day she got back messages on LinkedIn, variations on the same thing: “Is there any chance that this position could be 100 percent remote?” one woman asked. “If not, I would not be interested in hearing more about the role.” Dyba visited the start-up’s New York office, which was, predictably, filled with great light and had Kombucha on tap. It was vast, the lease signed during the pandemic. It was also basically empty. Dyba had to wonder in what numbers even current employees would eventually return to on-site work.',\n",
       "   'At least that other client, the tech employer on the West Coast seeking a data analyst, was willing to let whoever filled that position work entirely remotely. In late January, around 5:30 p.m., Dyba got on a screening call with a potential candidate. By then, she had reached the stage of day when her hair was up in a messy bun held with a pen. She was working in her bedroom, in green thermal pants and a Henley — it was not a big Zoom day — and her ancient Corgi was snoozing by her side. The day had been nonstop, and she hadn’t paused to drink any water, which she was now compensating for by chugging from a bottle while the candidate spoke.',\n",
       "   '“If you wouldn’t mind kind of talking me through your background, I would love to hear a little bit more about you and what you’ve been doing,” she said. The young man on the other end of the phone was lovely and polite, with a Master of Science degree in business analytics. Dyba was immediately charmed, if only because — unlike so many tech recruits — he didn’t start the conversation by asking, within the first six minutes, what the compensation was. He spoke about his background but also seemed to have researched the business itself. The nature of work has changed so much that sometimes, she knows, the recruits don’t care: Their top priority is remote work; and if they are going to be doing data analytics at home, a basic disconnect from the larger business can easily set in. (Another recruiter said that when she sends out mass blasts, she often gets back emails that say only three words: “Rate? Remote? Client?”)',\n",
       "   'Dyba recognized that there were details on the young man’s résumé that the employer might consider less than reassuring — like the fact that his last job had the word “intern” in it. “My fear is that they’ll say he doesn’t have the experience,” she said of the tech firm. But still, he impressed her with his obvious intelligence, his sophisticated response to a question about machine learning. She would fight for him and suggest, “If you’re willing to take a chance and help someone start his career, I think it would be a great move.” Maybe they would listen, she thought. Maybe.']},\n",

       "   'Linus Sebastian is the face of a mini YouTube empire. His company also resembles a scaled-down version of the Gap, employing a fashion designer, logistics experts, graphic designers and “fit technicians” to sell merchandise to fans.',\n",
       "   'Sebastian is among the online personalities who have figured out that putting their names or faces on products is increasingly a ticket to cashing in on fame.',\n",
       "   'Sales of themed merchandise like hoodies and plush toy video game controllers generated about 32 percent of the revenue for Sebastian’s Linus Media Group in 2021, up from 3 percent five years earlier, he told me. Sebastian said that “clothing is where really successful people like the Kardashians of the world” earn a living. (This isn’t totally true, but you get the idea.)',\n",
       "   'Advertising, the conventional way for people to earn money from online attention, is a bit more than half of the revenue for Linus Media Group. Most of the company’s videos about computers, video games and other tech gear have plugs for sponsors, and Sebastian’s company collects a share of revenue from ads and subscriptions that YouTube sells.',\n",
       "   'But it’s the merchandise that is both growing faster than other income streams, and requires different expertise than anything Sebastian has done before. “You can’t just slap your label on a T-shirt and hope that people will buy it,” he said.',\n",
       "   'On Tech has been writing a series of newsletters on the economics of internet creators, or people like Sebastian who are so good at making online videos and other material that they turn it into a living.',\n",
       "   'Sebastian offers a glimpse at the skills it takes to build a 21st-century media company. He is the chief executive who is equally comfortable sawing open old cable TV boxes for 14 million video subscribers and talking with me about wonky financial metrics.',\n",
       "   'Sebastian’s decade-long path to becoming a YouTube star essentially started with a dare from his former boss. Sebastian was working for a computer retail store, and it asked him to make videos to drum up sales. It’s easy to see why they caught on. Sebastian radiates fun in his videos even if, like me, you would never build a solid gold video game controller.',\n",
       "   'Then he had a disagreement over strategy with a higher-up, who told Sebastian that he could either fall in line or find another place to make videos, Sebastian said. He picked the second option. Sebastian started his own YouTube channel in 2013 and formed a business with his wife just months after they had their first child.',\n",
       "   'Today, Linus Media Group has about 65 employees, and a half-dozen YouTube channels that have a combined monthly viewership that could compete with the Super Bowl’s. Staff members write scripts, produce the videos and cut deals with sponsors. They also built a streaming video site to make money away from YouTube.',\n",
       "   'About 11 people work just on merchandise. Employees order blank water bottles and underwear from factories and contract with a local printing company in the Vancouver area to customize them. Others specialize in clothing design, customer service or moving products around the world. Selling merchandise is inherently more costly than selling ads.',\n",
       "   'It’s not always fun to make entertainment for the fickle tastes of millions of subscribers.',\n",
       "   '“You think your job is stressful?” Sebastian said. “I have 10 million bosses.” (Technically, 14 million.)',\n",

       "  'ArticleText': ['After Sept. 11, the lobbies in many U.S. office buildings permanently changed as landlords beefed up security, adding cameras, turnstiles, programmable elevators and other technological tools. All who entered were required to have identification, and guards recorded who came and went.',\n",
       "   'Now, as pandemic restrictions ease and workers begin to trickle back into the office, the lobby is changing again, this time with an emphasis on health and safety. But the changes are subtle, and they are primarily meant to ease the flow at the turnstile.',\n",
       "   'Most notably, mobile applications tied to building security or operating systems are replacing plastic ID badges for workers and the check-in process for visitors. The goal is to digitally connect anyone entering the building while minimizing direct contact. Body scanners and air sensors are expected to become more prominent in the future.',\n",
       "   'Unlike the extra security measures of the post-9/11 world, which were plain to see, the latest changes will go largely unnoticed, said Jurgen Timperman, president of fire and security at Carrier Global, a provider of building operating systems based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.',\n",
       "   '“With these applications, we have all the information we need about someone before they get to the building,” he said. “So the days where somebody sits behind a desk with a big book and pen are all but over.”',\n",
       "   'Building apps allow users to upload identification and other credentials, like their vaccine status, and offer the flexibility to add functions like health questionnaires that prescreen employees or visitors before their arrival. The apps can also track users throughout a building, which can help companies use space more efficiently or close areas to reduce occupancy.',\n",
       "   'Vendors are tight-lipped when it comes to how much building systems cost, as are the landlords who have installed them. One problem, they say, is that price varies with a building’s size and layout and the number of people, sensors and functions on the system.',\n",
       "   'The behind-the-scenes overhaul of security systems is catching on in office buildings and even at universities. Students and faculty at the Rochester Institute of Technology in upstate New York, for example, use a system from Carrier for mobile entry to buildings on campus.',\n",
       "   'The New York developer Silverstein Properties has introduced a contactless entry system for tenants at 7 World Trade Center in Manhattan that allows employees to use badges stored in Apple Wallet to gain access to office and amenity spaces. And at Deutsche Bank’s new offices in the former Time Warner Center, vaccination status is loaded onto employee badges for entry through its turnstiles, a spokesman said.',\n",
       "   'In August, Rubenstein Partners rolled out a platform and app from HqO, a provider of building operating systems, at a 500,000-square-foot office building known as 25 Kent in Brooklyn, about 16 months after it opened. Rubenstein had decided before the pandemic to use the technology in the new development, but the desire to create a contactless entry hastened the timing.',\n",
       "   '“In the past, when someone visited an office, you’d hand your ID to a security person. But with Covid, distance became a concern,” said Salvatore Dragone, director of property management for Rubenstein, which is based in Philadelphia. “Now you can preregister, and your phone opens a turnstile or elevator door. It gives us a lot more control as to who comes into the building.”',\n",
       "   'In addition to the apps, permanent but discreet temperature and body scanners and air sensors in lobbies and elsewhere could become more commonplace, especially if other airborne viruses or more coronavirus variants emerge.',\n",
       "   'As property managers continue to reimagine the office lobby, tenants and visitors can also expect a “concierge feel” in addition to basic security, Mr. Dragone said, as music, HVAC fragrance diffusers, art and other experiential elements become more commonplace.',\n",
       "   'And those plexiglass dividers? “I don’t think they’re there for good,” he added, “nor do we want them to stay longer than need be.”',\n",
       "   'The technology continues a movement to automate manual processes across industries. But in commercial real estate, it is also part of a trend to create a more hospitable and inviting atmosphere by borrowing ideas from hotel lobbies, like seating lounges and meeting areas, said Lenny Beaudoin, who oversees workplace, design and occupancy for CBRE, a commercial real estate brokerage firm. CBRE also created Host, an app for tenants and landlords, and other digital building operating solutions.',\n",
       "   '“What owners are providing in lobbies is largely a response to what tenants want, and ultimately that’s a more connected experience,” said Sandeep Davé, the chief digital and technology officer at CBRE. “The focus now is on the convergence of functions on a smartphone that will provide a contactless experience and encourage people to return to work, and to return safely.”',\n",
       "   'The pandemic has accelerated interest in contactless solutions, said James Scott, the lead researcher at the Real Estate Innovation Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.',\n",
       "   '“In light of Covid, the acceptance of new technology and its implementation became extremely important,” he said. “The adoption rate has accelerated by anywhere from three to five years.”',\n",
       "   'In a 2021 global survey, nearly two-thirds of 250 respondents said they had either adopted mobile credentialing to control building access or planned to over the next two years, according to IFSEC Global, an international security and fire safety news and conference organization in London.',\n",
       "   'Despite the urgency created by the pandemic, some landlords and property managers are still mulling how to best strengthen their lobby safety and security, and by how much.',\n",
       "   'Complicating matters is the lack of a unified system. The sector for building software solutions remains fragmented, with several property technology companies competing. And the abilities are still being explored. For instance, apps have been developed to automatically call an elevator when a person enters a building, but technology providers have yet to roll out the feature in a significant way, Mr. Scott said.',\n",
       "   'The same is true for the deployment of automated temperature scanners, he added. In many cases, temporary temperature-taking stations disappeared in 2021, before the Omicron variant of the coronavirus took hold.',\n",
       "   '“Once a pandemic loses its steam, these types of temporary measures tend to gather dust in a storage room unless they have been integrated into the framework of the building management system,” Mr. Scott said.',\n",
       "   'Expense is also a consideration, particularly in older buildings that lack a robust technology foundation, said W.A. Watts IV, president of the Institute of Real Estate Management, an international organization for property and asset managers.',\n",
       "   'For example, a project to retrofit an 18-year-old, 25,000-square-foot building in Birmingham, Ala., costs around $5 a square foot just to install base infrastructure, said Mr. Watts, who goes by Chip. He and other industry observers question whether low-density suburban offices in smaller markets even need to install such intensive security and safety measures.',\n",
       "   'But technological innovation is on its way, said Dawn M. Carpenter, the founder of Dawning Real Estate and a broker who manages about five million square feet of commercial real estate in New York.',\n",
       "   'In her 200,000-square-foot office building on Staten Island, security guards at the lobby desk still call tenants when visitors arrive, Ms. Carpenter said. The guests then wait until someone takes the elevator down to fetch them. Since Omicron hit, however, no visitors have been allowed.',\n",
       "   '“Adding a building operating system is a big capital expenditure, and owners have to buy into it,” she said. “There’s not one in this building yet, but it will be coming.”']},\n",

       "   'However, the second stage, unpowered and uncontrolled, was in an orbit unlikely to endanger any satellites, and people likely did not keep track of it.',\n",
       "   '“It would be very nice if the folks who are putting these boosters into high orbits would publicly disclose what they put up there and where they were going rather than my having to do all of this detective work,” Mr. Gray said.',\n",
       "   'But if this was not the DSCOVR rocket, what was it? Mr. Gray sifted through other launches in the preceding months, focusing on those headed toward the moon. “There’s not much in that category,” Mr. Gray said.',\n",
       "   'The top candidate was a Long March 3C rocket that launched China’s Chang’e-5 T1 spacecraft on Oct. 23, 2014. That spacecraft swung around the moon and headed back to Earth, dropping off a small return capsule that landed in Mongolia. It was a test leading up to the Chang’e-5 mission in 2020 that successfully scooped up moon rocks and dust and brought them back for study on Earth.',\n",
       "   'Running a computer simulation of the orbit of WE0913A back in time showed that it would have made a close lunar flyby on Oct. 28, five days after the Chinese launch.',\n",
       "   'In addition, orbital data from a cubesat that was attached to the third stage of the Long March rocket “are pretty much a dead ringer” to WE0913A, Mr. Gray said. “It’s the sort of case you could probably take to a jury and get a conviction.”',\n",
       "   'More observations this month shifted the prediction of when the object will strike the moon by a few seconds and a few miles to the east. “It still looks like the same thing,” said Christophe Demeautis, an amateur astronomer in northeast France.',\n",
       "   'There is still no chance of it missing the moon.',\n",
       "   'The crash will occur at about 7:26 a.m. Eastern time, but because the impact will be on the far side of the moon, it will be out of view of Earth’s telescopes and satellites.',\n",
       "   'As for what happened to that Falcon 9 part, “we’re still trying to figure out where the DSCOVR second stage might be,” Mr. Gray said.',\n",
       "   'The best guess is that it ended up in orbit around the sun instead of the Earth, and it could still be out there. That would put it out of view for now. There is precedent for pieces of old rockets coming back: In 2020, a newly discovered mystery object turned out to be part of a rocket launched in 1966 for NASA’s robotic Surveyor missions to the moon.']},\n",

BlockFi should have registered them as securities and should have registered itself as an investment company, the S.E.C. found.',\n",

The company also said it would stop offering that product to new U.S. customers. BlockFi has 60 days to meet the S.E.C.’s registration requirements.',\n",
